However, he said\nthat there was no target date for completing the process.\n    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to\nrealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had\npaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which\noperates outside Unilever's core activities.\n    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,\nconsiderable expansion in the household products business and\nin margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.\n    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business\nhad turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance\nbetter than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs\nof its Surf detergents.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

As a\nresult, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange\nreserves during the year,\" he said.\n    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign\nexchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a\npeak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.\n    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a\nbarrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.\n    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline\nin the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more\ndifficult to finance the government's budget deficit.\n    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on\nservicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of\ncapital for the first time in its history, he added.\n    \"This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult\nphase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that\nwe raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign\nsources to finance our development,\" he said.\n    \"It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on\nexpenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the\nlead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more\nfrugal in satisfying immediate needs,\" the president added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing\nfour information technology systems that will be led by today's\nhighest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.\n    The company said information management products will be\nthe focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business\ncommunications campaign under the threme \"The New Vision of\nKodak.\"\n    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,\nKodak said its information technology sales exceeded four\nbillion dlrs in 1986. \"If the Kodak divisions generating those\nsales were independent, that company would rank among the top\n100 of the Fortune 500,\" it pointed out.\n    The objective of Kodak's \"new vision\" communications\ncampaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's\ncommitment to the business and industrial sector.\n    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the\ninformation management systems unveilded today --\n    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more\nthan a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).\n    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information\nmanagement system using optical disks or microfilm or both.\n    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system\nthat allows users to integrate optical disks into their current\ninformation management systems.\n    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,\ncomputer-assisted system which can be a starter system.\n    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a\nwrite-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will\nmarket on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in\n1988.\n    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up\nto 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes\nof randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed\nout, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.\n    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000\nin mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system \nallows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,\nincluding erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,\nfiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to\nsell in the 700,000 dlr range.\n    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk\nversion which provides data storage and retrieval through a\ndisk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing\n2.6 gigabytes.\n    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of\nthe family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually\nloaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs\nwith deliveries beginning in mid-year.\n    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with\nthe more powerful KIMS system 5000.\n    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and\nsoftware as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987\nand sell in the 150,000 dlr range.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.\n    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change\nslaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a\nfew months later by the hormone rule.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

These would correspond to the eligible\nconstituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.\n    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be\nintroduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc\n<SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc <PLYL.L> from\nMarch 19.\n    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United\nStates for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two\ncurrency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an\noption on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.\n    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate\nthe London options market's leading position in Europe,\nespecially important with French and Swiss equity options\ntrading planned to start this year.\n    \"I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are\nconservative,\" one leading options analyst said, predicting\ncontinuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least\nthe next year.\n    He said much of the recent growth in options had come from\ninter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But\nnow the retail options market was beginning to take off.\n    The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted\nfloor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left\nalmost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in\nthe equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have\nencouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.\n    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to\nequities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a\nfinal decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.\n    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options\nmarket, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the\noptions market would need more than half of the available\nspace.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail\ndeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but\nlower securities commissions from international investment bank\noperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.\n    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to\n98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in\nconsumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

We\nhave to avoid that.\"\n    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of\nits massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with\nEC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted \nshipments of Asian textiles.\n    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve\nEC trade issues, saying \"each time we come in contact, it a\nconflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.\"\n    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross\nthe Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.\n    \"This is not the way to work in a serious way between two\nbig powers,\" De Croo said.\n   \n reuter\n\u0003",

But among\nhis chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser\ndeveloped countries and their ability to pay for their imports.\n    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring\nexport credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,\nhe said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of\nthing we want to take a look at.\"\n    \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in\na peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\"\nStephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will\nstrike more countries from its list of political risk insurance\nrecipients.\n    He noted that certain countries have already been removed\nfrom the list.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

American Airlines will use the\nplanes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its\nservice in the Caribbean and to Europe.\n    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the\nplanes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.\nThe carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year\nextension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days\nnotice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman\nRobert Crandall.\n    \"We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,\"\nCrandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals \"off\nbalance sheet\" limited obligation leases, under which the\nfinancing is provided by the manufacturers.\n    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. \"We will own\nthe aircraft and they will be leasing them from us,\" he said.\nAirbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,\nlong-range A300-600 planes.\n    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of\nBoeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part\nof the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.\n    Analysts said \"walkaway lease\" deals have been used before\nby airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of\nplanes, but not to this extent.\n    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will\ngive AMR financial stability as it grows. \"AMR is using the\nmanufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and\nconsequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into\nthe early 1990s,\" he said.\n    \"The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will\nincreasingly become operators of assets rather than owners\" to\nreduce their exposure to risk, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the\nlarge backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations\nthat continue to operate,\" Wolf said.\n    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's\nplan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize\nFSLIC.\n    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC\ninsured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were\ninsolvent.\n    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,\nearning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three\nquarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations\nlost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.\n    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.\n    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of\nDallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight\nbillion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings\nassociations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said\nare considered \"hopelessly insolvent\".\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "GE <GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER",
  "body": "One of General Electric Co's biggest\nbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing\nprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,\nWall Street analysts said.\n    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and\ndecline at some point in the next five years. The improved\noutlook results from AMR Corp's <AMR> decision to order 40 new\nplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.\n    \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" said\nNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements\nfor its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>\ntwinjet long distance aircraft.\n    But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allow\nit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt\nstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the\nplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects\nAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe\ndownturn in the economy.\n    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal\nfor several reasons, Heymann said.\n    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of\ndelivery, Heymann noted.\n    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes\nGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,\nwould have little trouble rounding up another airline that\nwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal\nappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.\n    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by\nmidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham\nand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no one\norder will have much of an effect on the stock.\"\n    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the\norder \"will help to maintain a good level of production and\nprofitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE.\n    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine\nbusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs\nby 1991.\n    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last\nyear, with well over half of the business in the military\nsector, according to analysts' estimates.\n    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides\nwith an upbeat performance in other segments.\n    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first\nquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,\nhe believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp\nthat it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business and\nreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other\nelements of its 14 business areas.\n    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current\nquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the\nNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.\n    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part\ncrediting \"significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The specialty retailing area continues\nto pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and\ndime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.\n    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for\nthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years\nago.\n    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs\nper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs\nper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared\nwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.\n    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose\n10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with\n1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.\nRevenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.\n    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that\nincome generated by the company's specialty store operations\naccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.\n    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores\noperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650\nmore specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it\noperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.\n    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by\nWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman\napparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain\nof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount\ndrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,\nwhich sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700\nWoolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of\nwhich 1,200 are in the United States.\n    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,\nsaid in a statement, \"These results are especially gratifying as\nthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings.\"\n    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in\neach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier\nperiod.\n    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the\n1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store\nindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth\nopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,\na discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United\nStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.\n    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and\nannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,\nthe company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.\nSpecialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot\nthan general merchandise stores.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this\nyear.\n    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will\nlikely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.\n    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade\nperformance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in\nthe current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs\nfrom the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.\n    \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from\nmerchandise trade transactions where imports continued to\nadvance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the\nfederal agency said in a statement.\n    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion\ndlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.\neconomy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and\nhelp fuel the country's modest expansion.

  "title": "BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS",
  "body": "The Bank of England proposed that banks\nin Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization\nto be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.\n    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of\ncredit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they\nlead manage.\n    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative\npaper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and\ndeposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.\n    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond\nsecurities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of\nnew eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by\nEuromoney magazine.\n    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead\nmanaging eurobond issues.\n    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of\nEngland is concerned about intense competition for market share\nwhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves to\nimprudent credit risk.\n    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as\nbanks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules\nsuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as\nregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk\nthan it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of\nEngland is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to\naccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters\nact prudently.\n    \"The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's\nlead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill\nand experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market\nconcerned...,\" the Bank's proposal said.\n    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead\nunderwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the\nface amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60\npct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it\nmust be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of\ncapital.\n    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of\n28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After\nthat, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be\nassessed at their full face value.\n    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,\nrevolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.\n    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen\nits supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called\nfor comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their\npossible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned\nfinal discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.\n    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the\nthird leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the\nsupervision of financial institutions.\n    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,\naimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building\nSocieties Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing\nwith banks.\n    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between\nrecognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal\ncontrols, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.\n    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in\nadvance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their\ncapital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10\nand 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.\n    However, preliminary consultations with bank\nrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be\nflawed, it said.\n    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a\ncase-by-case basis rather than along general lines.\n    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of\nexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other\nunits of their own group of companies, the paper showed.\n    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to\nlocal governments and other public sector entities, and of\nexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.\n    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as\ncollateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.\n    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their\nown group of companies would usually be looked into on a\ncase-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.\n    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and\nother public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should\nbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments\nprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.\n    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and\nthose guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee\nDepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment.\n    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of\nanother bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling\ncould be exceeded in individual cases.\n    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking\nto take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state\nin writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's\nbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.\n    On collateral security, it said this \"should normally only\nbe taken into account when considering the acceptability of a\nbank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.\"\n    \"The presence of security taken on its own will be\nconsidered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure\nin excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional\ncircumstances and even then to a very limited extent,\" it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE",
  "body": "Soviet winter grains could be off to\na faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall\nand cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.\n    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the\nSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to\nforecast any major crop problems, analysts said.\n    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six\nweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and\nfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.\n    \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that\nthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a\nlower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist\nfor E.F. Hutton said.\n    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will\nbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of\nthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.\n    \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of\nus,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.\n    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares\nof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.\nThis would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop\nand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the\nUSDA analyst said.\n    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able\nto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts\nnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops\n-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.\n    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover\ncombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\n    \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\nentire winter crop area, she said.\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\nfall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,\nthe cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would\nrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.\n    \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they\ndon't have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said.\n    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and\nif they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a\none-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet\nbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.\n    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the\nSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.\n    \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and\na half,\" Martell said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Crude oil prices rallied today, moving\nover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined\neffort to support prices, analysts said.\n    \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,\nhoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without\nanother meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\n    \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to\nseasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added.\n    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt\nto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from\nthe official prices agreed to last december.\n    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,\nSaudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the\nCooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.\n    The Saudis have also offered to support members having\ndifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.\n    \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to\nprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC\nmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help members\nthat lose sales,\" Margoshes said.\n    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form\nof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.\n    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line\nnations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it\nis also likely that such assistance would be provided to\nNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.\n    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC\npresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC\nmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the\nDecember pact is falling apart.\n    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham\nHarris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been\noversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short\ncovering rally.\"\n    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which\nrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners\ninto the market to cover their short positions.\n    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market\nto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast\nsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading\nyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the\nNorth sea crude oil market.\n    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today\nthat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent\nfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels\nbeing fixed to make such shipments.\n    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades\nreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.\n    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their\nquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.\n    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC\nproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last\ndecember but he gave no details on OPEC production against\nclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.\n    \"The production probably is about their quota level and\nlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell\nits oil as a result,\" Margoshes said.\n    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the\ncurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if\nSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.\n    But others said that despite the rally today there were\nstill several fundamental factors, including demand, which\ncould cut the rally short.\n    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said\nslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep\ndemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise\nabout 1.4 pct over 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS",
  "body": "Coffee prices may have to fall even lower\nto bring exporting and importing countries once more round the\nnegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and\ntraders said.\n    The failure last night of International Coffee\nOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree\nexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee\nfutures markets today with the London May price reaching a\n4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before\nending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous\nclose.\n    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.\n    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the\nICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope\nthe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor\nunder prices, some senior traders said.\n    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for\nMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Anything over\nthat figure had to be sold.\n    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law\nrequired that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of\nthe common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,\nBarron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to the\nHilton lawyers.\n    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax\nlaw, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block\nof stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was\nattempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving\nthe family in control of the corporation.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.\ncrude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a\nbelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.\n    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production\ncould push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as\nearly as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.\n    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil\nshould strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the\norganization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a\nbarrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from\nswitching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market\naccounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the\nworld demand for oil.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

That gives\ndeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.\n    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they\nsign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.\n    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,\ntraders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing\nrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop\nsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more\nattractive under normal circumstances.\n    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the\nlimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,\nmeans farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln\nmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,\ntraders said.\n    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of\nshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the\nmore attractive deal from the government, they added.\n    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six\nmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to\nput soybean land back into cotton.\n    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean\nproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres in\ntraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,\nwhich are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Wall Street analysts said a share\nrepurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part\nan attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent\nrepurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.\n    \"He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger\" said analyst\nJoseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. \"There was a firestorm of\ncriticism from people on the institutional side.\"\n    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the\nshares in the near term but some had reservations about the\nlong term effects of the plan.\n    \"They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by\nthe buyout of Ross Perot,\" said analyst David Healy of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert Inc.\n    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been\nhinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional\ninvestors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five\nbillion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor\nCo's <F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis\nthan that of Chrysler Corp <C>.\n    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy\nback stock on a large scale.\n    The General Motors plan, announced after a board of\ndirectors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20\npct of the common stock by the end of 1990.\n    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln\nclass E <GME> and class H <GMH> shares. GM shares closed at\n75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's\nannouncement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which\ntrades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was\nmaking a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.\n    \"The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow,\" said\nRonald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.\n    \"I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming\nfrom unless they borrow,\" Glantz said. \"Their credit rating is\ngoing to fall.\" GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive\ncapital spending.\n    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by\ngoing ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has\n37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for\nclosing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for\nworkers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs \"this will be\nseen as rubbing salt into the wound,\" Glantz said. \"GM must be\nchallenging the union to make it the strike target.\"\n    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM\nand expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think\nthe overall plan was \"prudent.\"\n    \"Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in\nthe stock tomorrow,\" Hutton's Phillippi said.\n    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost\nreduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels\n\"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the\nconfines of their cash flow.\" Phillippi, who has been telling\nclients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance\n\"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Usually, the issuer of a\nfloating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice\nversa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains\nwith the original borrower.\n    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of\nswaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some\nportion of the risk but is not required to show it on the\nbalance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient\ncapital to cushion it.\n    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president\nof Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of\nEngland and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later\ntoday to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital\nstandards for counterparties in swaps.\n    The standards are part of the recently announced\nconvergence agreement between the two countries in which\nregulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements\nfor institutions.\n    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a\n\"level playing field\" be maintained in the swaps market.\n    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more\nprimary capital against swap transactions than is the current\npractice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to\nissuers.\n    The issuers might then choose to do business with\nlower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking\nrules.\n    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for\nswap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.\n    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "European Community Farm Commissioner\nFrans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy\noutput cuts over two years and promised new measures to help\nfarmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.\n    \"We are now in a favourable position to improve the\nsituation in the dairy sector,\" he told a news conference.\n    The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion\nEuropean Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of\nbutter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new\nstocks from accruing.\n    A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in\nDecember, but approval was held up by a row over Commission\nproposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus\nstocks into store.\n    After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed\nrules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public\nstocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices\nwere sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.\n    Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what\nhe said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for\ncuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming\nseason.\n    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu\npackage of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay\ncompensation to those who opt for less intensive production\nmethods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections\nhad forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which\nhe had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.\n    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older\nfarmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out\nof agricultural production or passing it to successors.\n    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the\nEC and member states to provide direct income supports to\nhard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give\nfull details, but member state aid would be subject to \"strict\ncriteria to avoid distortion of competition.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing\nto 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986,\nand will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing\npayments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris\nHalikias, said.\n    He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded\nimmediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low\ninternational interest rates in order to make servicing\npayments at a lower cost.\n    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at\nend-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.\n    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will\ngo towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not\ngive figures.\n    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year\nausterity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current\naccount deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record\n3.3 billion in 1985.\n    Halikias said he was \"fairly optimistic\" Greece would reach a\ncurrent account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for\nimports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.\n    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion\ndlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the\nsame. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs\nfrom 11.4 billion.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals\nand completion of formal documentation.\n    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items\nrose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.\n    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2\npreferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain\nsuspended.\n    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly\ndividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's\ntrustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.\n    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of\nthe March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred\nshareholders, with payment expected in early April to\nshareholders of record March 31, the company said.\n    If future dividends are not declared after the April\nexchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will\ndepend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast\nTransmission Co <WTC>, B.C.

  "body": "Venezuela plans to have a public sector\nforeign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the\npresent government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,\npublic finances director Jorge Marcano said.\n    He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion\ndlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable\namount which will assist in development plans.\n    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank\nadvisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling\naccord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8\npct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.\n    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said\nhe thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do\nwith the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision\nto suspend interest payments.\n    \"I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the\nU.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften\ntheir position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil\nannouncement came later,\" he said.\n    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,\nobjecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact\nwith Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before\nVenezuela's.\n    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors\nseeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,\nwhich are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. \"We\ncannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new\nagreement and present the financing programmes we have,\" he\nsaid, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.\n    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign\nborrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral\nagencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next\ntwo years. According to the restructured accord, this would\nwork out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan\nthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach European\nCommunity levels, director-general of the INFE export\ninstitute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.\n    \"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic\nProduct over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,\" he\nsaid.\n     \"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there\nis no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,\nwhich have a similar productive structure,\" he said.\n    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other\nfiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in\ninternational trade fairs.\n    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as\ntraditional industrial exports will be promoted.\n    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20\nbillion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the\ngovernment's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special\n25 billion peseta grant.\n    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in\nreal terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.\n    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in\ndeveloping countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,\nwhich rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.\n    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\ncountries.\n    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the\nCommunity rose seven pct last year. The government plans to\nconcentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.\n    \"The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are\nvital to survival in the context of EC competition,\" he said.\n    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the\ndomestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while\nturning their backs on foreign markets.\n    \"They have to realise their share of the home market is\ngoing to shrink with growing deregulation,\" he said. \"Foreign\ncompanies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and\nit is it vital to secure a market share abroad.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER",
  "body": "A leaf disease affecting seven pct of\nSri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and\nraise currently depressed prices, industry officials and\nresearchers told Reuters.\n    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber\nResearch Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus\n\"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the\nleaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.\n    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the\ncrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.\nLast year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000\ntonnes.\n    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber\nclones if no immediate action is taken.\n    \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees\nseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use\nchemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said.\n    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at\nPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the\nfungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State\nPlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.\n    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber\nland with the balance belonging to small private producers with\na total of 145,600 hectares.\n    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research\nInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for\nplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these\nclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older\nPBX Malaysian clones.\n    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided\nto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be\ntreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.\n    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week\nbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there\nis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman\nfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.\n    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about\nfour rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe\none-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this\nweek's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same\nperiod.\n    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average\nof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in\nDecember because of wintering in early February in producing\nareas.\n    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with\nthe supply position showing improvements.\n    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last\nmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions.\n    \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,\nmeant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of\nthe rubber we already had,\" one buyer said.\n    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and\nspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals\naggravated the problem.\n    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter\nclosures of factories and also in the hope that prices would\nease further.\n    They said another problem that could hit the industry is\nthe dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains\nexpected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further\nshortages,\" one official said.\n    \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Geneva Motor Show, the first major\ncar show of the year, opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers\nhoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the\ncheap dollar, automobile executives said.\n    Ford Motor Co <F> and General Motors Corp <GM> sell cars in\nEurope, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM\nalso makes a few thousand in North American plants for European\nexport.\n     Now Chrysler Corp <C> is saying it will begin exporting\nAmerican-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a\nmarket it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy.\n    Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany\nmanufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last\nyear -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European\nmarket.\n    Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and\nBritain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about\n1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.\n    James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped\nfor a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made\nvehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North\nAmerican-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. \"A\nlow dollar makes our prices very attractive,\" he told Reuters.\n    Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his\nprojected sales figure would translate into between 91 million\nand 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added.\n    That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500\nNorth-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs.\n    Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all\nof its cars sold on the continent.  But Walter Hayes, vice\npresident of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a\nlarge rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. \n\"We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe\nis inevitably a small volume market.\"\n    Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to\nEuropean environmental specifications cut into profit margins.\n    But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said\nthe weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. \n\"After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to\nre-enter the European market,\" he said.\n    \"We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here\nbecause it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of\nthe favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the\ndollar.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM",
  "body": "The Bundesbank is planning changes in\nthe system by which banks bid for funds in securities\nrepurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open\nmarket instrument, central bank officials said.\n    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender\nprocess to two days from three currently, enabling the\nBundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it\nchooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.\n    The changes will probably come into force in April.\n    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at\nthe tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank\nfor subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.\n    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody\naccounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,\nwhich are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.\n    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such\naccounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.\n    The change to come into force next month will allow the\nBundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,\nin a process legally comparable to direct debiting.\n    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on\nMonday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the\nresult early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.\n    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28\ndays. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or\nlonger tender periods being necessary.\n    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday\nto be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow\n(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the\ncarnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt\nyesterday (Tuesday).\n    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the\nshortening of the tender process should be seen as purely\ntechnical, with no direct implications for interest rates.\n    \"It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,\"\nsaid an official at the Hesse LZB.\n    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December\nthat security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater\nsuccess since their introduction in their present form two\nyears ago, and praised their flexibility.\n    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact\ninstrument even more flexible, banking economists said.\n    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it\npossible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for\nperiods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,\nto respond to changing money market conditions.\n    \"With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be\nrefined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates,\" said\nBerliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann\nRemsperger.\n    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money\nmarket developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest\nrates, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Federal Reserve Board voted\nunanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of\ninterest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort\nto come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that\ntakes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other\nassets.\n    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues\ntoday by the Bank of England.\n    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.\n    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks\nassociated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange\ncontracts and similar financial instruments.\n    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines\nfor calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities\nthat banks would be required to take into account in\ncalculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to\nmaintain.\n    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans\nand other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that\nwould establish a bank's minimum capital needs.\n    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine\nthe amount of capital support required for a bank's current\nexposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.\n    The current exposure would be measured by the\nmark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the\nreplacement cost.\n    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be\ncalculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical\nanalyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking\nregulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the\nasset.\n    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance\nconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.\n    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the\nparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.\n    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the\ncapital required of the largest money center banks, which are\nthe principal participants in these types of activities.\n    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the\npotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to\ncompete in world financial markets.\n    However, the staff concluded, \"The credit risks inherent in\nsuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk\nprofiles of some banking organizations.\"\n    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest\nparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits of\nincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.\n    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange\ncontracts traded on organized exchanges.\n    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was\nnot involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital\nrules.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of\nsocial and structural measures agreed early today by European\nCommunity farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers\nfor reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission\nsources said.\n    The ministers agreed that under this \"extensification\"\nscheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut\noutput of specific products by at least 20 pct.\n    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and\nwine, they added.\n    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by\nreducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their\nnumber of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,\nfarmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity\nfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.\n    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but\nwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on\nthe production they forego.\n    The sources said the package also contains provisions for\npayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting\nor improving the environment.\n    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured\nfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present such\nallowances are available only for livestock.\n    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into\nalternative farming techniques, the sources added.\n    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen\nsaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the\nEC and member states to provide direct income supports for\nrelatively poor farmers.\n    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state\naid would be subject to \"strict criteria to avoid distortion of\ncompetition.\"\n    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a\ndifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus\nproduction.\n    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night\nproposals to pay \"early retirement\" pensions to farmers aged 55\nor over who gave up production. Those who took their land\ncompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to\ntheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.\n    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised\nproposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme\nagreed.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal\nReserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to\nmeasure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not\nshow up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.\n    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options\ninvolving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals\nagreed in January between the two central banks to make\ncommercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar\nstandards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.\n    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks\nhave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.\n    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.\n    \"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate\ncapital support for potential future exposure -- on the other\nhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital\nrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And\nU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\"\n     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the\nso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a\ncurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its\npotential change in value due to currency or interest rate\nfluctuations until the contract matures.\n    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance\nsheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of\nfive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the\nquality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the\ncontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the\nplans showed.\n    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would\nnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.\n    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk\nweights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.\nAnd U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national\ngovernment agencies, the proposals showed.\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\noptions exchanges.\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\nwere keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\n    It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\nfurther development and implementation,\" and said some of the\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\n    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot\nforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and\noptions exchanges.\n    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England\nwere keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate\nmultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single\nagreement to create one single payments stream.\n    It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain\ncircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their\nfurther development and implementation,\" and said some of the\ncurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.",
  "body": "Failure of talks on re-establishing\nInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week\nmay put political pressure on the United States, particularly\nthe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is\nunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by\n\"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said.\n    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head\nof Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his\nreturn from London that the United States is willing to resume\nthe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.\n    Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in\ndiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria and\nany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of\nestablishing an objective method of setting quotas.\n    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,\nproposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated\nby a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable\nproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led by\nBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of\nshares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\nwith any future coffee quotas.\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\ntalks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\nto soften the consumer position.\n    \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\nconsumers,\" said one U.S. official.\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\nobjective criteria.\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\nproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\nother African producers during the talks.\n    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\nalthough not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\n    While political manuevering by small producers and\nconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\nkey to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.\n    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the\nfailure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\nBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST",
  "body": "Torrential rains throughout\nArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse\ngrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.\n    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly\naffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to\nsoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or\nMay.\n    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum\ncrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields\nand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.\n    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,\nwith the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,\nbetween 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10\nand 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40\nmm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.\n    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.\n    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of\nthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.\n    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa\nFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.\n    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was\nestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to\nseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11\nmln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6\nmln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,\nor 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to\nofficial figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine\npct of total planted area.\n    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers\nfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure\nof 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln\nand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and\n41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and\nfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to\n1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln\nhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and\n3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2\nmillion tonnes harvested in 1985/86.\n    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a\nrecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of\n11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3\nmln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures\nput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.\n    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good\ncondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.\n    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is\nexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to\n13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments\ndeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking\nsteps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali\nTigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning\nOrganisation said.\n    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of\neconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,\nwhich he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.\n    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a\ndrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury\nwholesale index last year.\n    This year's target of 20 pct \"might be attainable but the\neconomic management will have to be careful,\" he said.\n    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme\nwhich is central to the government's economic planning, said\nTurkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account\nshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.\n    \"We must alleviate the current account substantially to\nsustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure\nover the last five years,\" he added.\n    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said\nAnkara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms\nwould look better if inflation were lower and the current\naccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.\n    \"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector\ninvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a\npercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible\nimprovement in the current account deficit,\" he said.\n    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was\nalso to blame for the high deficits.\n    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by\neight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign\nborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.\n    \"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the\ninvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" he\nsaid. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing\nrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated\n5.6 pct in 1986.\n    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also\ntargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage\nexports, and production incentives were being considered.\n    \"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected\ninto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion\npolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and\nlocal private capital come more into play as far as\nmanufacturing capacity is concerned,\" Tigrel said.\n    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish\neconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under\nway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate\npolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done\nin a country where the state still dominates industry and the\ncurrency is only partially convertible.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION",
  "body": "Drilling for oil in California is\nlikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels\ndespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is\nthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to\nincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery\nis seen in drilling, they said.\n    \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\"\nsaid John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.\n    Few new wells now are being drilled.\n    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,\nwere drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared\nto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil\nInformation Services, which tracks California drilling\nactivity.\n    \"It's in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state's\ndrilling activity.\n    Current prices are not enough to justify increased\ndrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent\nProducers Association.\n    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact\nto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices\neventually fell.\n    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have\nslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high\nof about 17 dlrs.\n    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper\nwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that\nmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to\nextract, Malmgreen said.\n    \"It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\"\nMalmgreen said.\n    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast\nproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland\nwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur\nextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.\n    The outlook for future production in California is clouded\nby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.\n    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which\nproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory\ndrilling has slowed to a crawl.\n    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in\n1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of\nthe state energy commission. So far this year only five\nexploratory wells have been drilled.\n    \"I don't think they'll even get to what they did last\nyear,\" Mitchell said.\n    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of\nthe decade, Mitchell said.\n    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the\nnumber of producing wells and overall production.\n    Between February and October of 1986, the number of\nproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from\nmore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy\nCommission.\n    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output\nfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is\nexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.\n    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil\nproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels\nper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.\n    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986\nwas 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405\nmln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of\nConservation.\n    \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\"\nGuerard said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival\nand whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.\"\n    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will\nrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.\n    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is\ndelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.\n    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,\nobtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the\nfarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If\nprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.\n    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in\nApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the\nfederal cabinet.\n    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27\npct but last fall the government announced a one billion\nCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.\n    But federal agricultural officials have already warned\nfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS <GM>",
  "body": "General Motors Corp staged an explosive\nrally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced\nyesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by\nstiff competition and erosion of market share.\n    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \ndiffered sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.\n    \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing\nshareholder value.\"\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\nrecapture lost market share.\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\ngood performance expected from new car models.\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\n    \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\nHealy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and\nChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\nimprovement in coming months.\n    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\n    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\n    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\nmarket share.\n    \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\nonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\n    \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a\ntransition year for GM,\" he said.\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\naffect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they\nearn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's\nimportant.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL",
  "body": "Healthy growth in corporate profits and in\nconsumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its\nhopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the\ncore, economists polled by Reuters said.\n    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace\nexports as the engine of growth. But close ties between\ncorporate performance and wages mean that the alternative\neconomic model promises little but slower growth, they said.\n    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn\nwill cut sales and further reduce profits.\n    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved\nterms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic\ndemand grow steadily.\n    However, this would happen only if household spending\nincreased in line with the value of real financial assets due\nto stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as\nprofits from domestic sales improved compared with those from\nexports.\n    \"No clear sign of such developments has so far been\nevidenced,\" the central bank said.\n    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth\nwill be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved\nsharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips\nand Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct\nwhile output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price\nmargin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies\ndid not pass that advantage on to the consumer.\n    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the\nfall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in\nconsumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of\ntrade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.\n    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will\nprotect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek\nmore profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic\ncompetition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.\nRetail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.\n    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren\nconfirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.\n    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost\n80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production\nvolume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,\nsaid Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.\n    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting\nunprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors\n(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down\nwages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears\nunemployment could soon double from three pct now.\n    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt\nsales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual\nfinancial security could be even more damaging.\n    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what\namounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to\nbuy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.\n    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied\nbonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.\n    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than\nthe average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a\npoor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the\nresolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,\nand housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.\n    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80\npct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly\nageing population and minimal social security and its workers\nfear poverty in their old age.\n    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's\nreflationary strategies are severely limited.\n    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and\nFinance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small\nsupplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive\nwithout reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less\nthan excited at the results.\n    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.\n    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically\nimpossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate\nat only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.\n    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some\nkind of deposit, official figures show.\n    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while\nfirms are planning cuts in capital investment.\n    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land\nprices are the only current results of high liquidity.\n    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political\nanalysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big\nelection victory largely to a long period of almost zero price\ninflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a\nsales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He said that the\nmajority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well\ncategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be\ncrucial in determining if the well remains in production.\n    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new\nwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years\nas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.\n    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of\nproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recover\noil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent\nsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary\nwells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day\nfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a\nbarrel.\n    \"We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal\nadministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the\nnation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent\nsaid. \"In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,\nfollow, or get out of the way.\"\n    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury\nby exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes\nwould be more than made up by stimulating new business for the\noil supply and service industry.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He noted that all captial\nspending will be internally financed.\n    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some\nregulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific\nBell operating company.\n    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility\nCommission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr\nrevenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the\ncommission, he said the figure might even be greater.\n    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr\nrate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found\n180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations\nand assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded\nmodernization costs.\n    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether\nto join an international consortium that plans to lay a\ntranspacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.\n    \"We have not agreed to anything,\" Guinn said, but added he\nwould soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the\ncompany would make a decision soon on participating.\n    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the\nU.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating\ncompanies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said\nthe company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.\n    \"(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.\nIt's a commodity business and becoming more so,\" he said. \"I'm\nnot so sure we would be interested in getting back into that\nbusiness.\"\n    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.\nrecommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the\nBell operating companies to expand into non-regulated\nbusinesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic\nalliances with other companies.\n    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into\nnew areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition\ntalks. \"We do not have anything actively under consideration,\"\nhe said.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY",
  "body": "U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking\nbanks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion\nthem against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency\nswap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.\n    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by\nthe Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said\nthat in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside\nreserves twice for the same risk.\n    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the\nproposals.\n    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially\nsignificant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume\nof about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled\nby Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in\neurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved\nin some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that\nabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are\noutstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the\nInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of\nKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association\nhas no comment and will study the proposals.\n    \"What they are proposing is really double counting,\" Patrick\nde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley\nand Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be\nrequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct\nper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of\nreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.\n    \"The potential risk factors are very large relative to what\nwe had expected,\" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.\n\"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --\nto borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might\nhave 10 years from now,\" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).\n    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by\nthe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a\ncompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass the\ncosts on to customers.\n    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the\nexclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal\nReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the\nproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that\nJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new\ncapital rules.\n     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank\nregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,\noffsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single\ncounterparty against each other.\n    The paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that\nsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce\ncredit risk.\" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting\nagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it\nmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.\n    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an\nairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.\n     \"One problem is that there has never been a major default\nin the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap\narrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank\nofficial.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Canadian government's reduced\nborrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make \"aggressive\nuse\" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of\nfinancing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.\n    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also\nnoted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs\nat the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in\nJanuary, 1986, and that the country's economy performed\nunevenly while inflation remained a major concern.\n    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new\nbond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the\nreliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly\nmore through short term treasury bill financings.\n    \"The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant\nthat the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances\nand lower financing costs,\" said Bouey who was replaced by\ndeputy governor John Crow last month.\n    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was\n69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the\nyear and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.\n    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an\neight billion dlr decline in the government's financing\nrequirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and\ngeneration of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange\ntransactions.\n    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made\ngreater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to\nfive year maturities, Bouey said.\n    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to\nbanks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average\nof 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion\ndlrs in March, 1986.\n    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian\nCommercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and\nthe Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been\nliquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and\nthe remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the\nadvances.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity\nfor traders to \"front-run\" or trade their own accounts at more\nfavorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner\nsaid he expects the special committee to report its findings\nlate next week and the board to act when those findings are\npresented.\n    In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a\nban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already\nunanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P\n500 futures at a prior meeting.\n    The change was withheld, however, at the request of the\nspecial committee after a study was released and the committee\nfelt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively,\nSandner said.\n    Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on\ndual trading and \"the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to\na ban on dual trading.\"\n    Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special\nstudy committee is considering changes only for S and P 500\nfutures and options on futures.\n    In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is\nalso expected to make recommendations on the possibility for\nelectronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures\nand rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P\ntrading pit, Melamed said.\n    Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special\ncommittee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are\nusually approved by the exchange board of directors.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "LEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA",
  "body": "Key tax and budget lawmakers\nWednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new\nsecurities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street\nand put pressure on brokerage stocks.\n    Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut\nfederal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target\nof 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax\nbe studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.\n    The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways\nand Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would\ntax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5\npercent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.\n    Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early\nto back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities\ntransfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by\ncongressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.\n    The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he\nis reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan\nmaintains his staunch opposition.\n    \"First we've got to decide whether to raise additional\nrevenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At\nthis point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,\"\nRostenkowski said in a statement.\n    He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting\nTuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source\nsaid. The idea was presented only as something that might or\nmight not be valuable, he said.\n    House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was\nanother option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed\nto raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.\n   The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend\nspecific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee\nwill recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in\n1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision\non how the taxes will be raised.\n    The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of\nrevenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the\ndeficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.\n    But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive\nsecurities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and\nthere were uncertainties about the details of the tax.\n    Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so\nfar this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the\nbudget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no\ndecisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.\n    At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a\ngeneral tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that\nare guaranteed to anger those who must pay.\n    \"We could just do all of them,\" one congressional source said\nof the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil\nimport fee and others.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He noted that the number of motion\npicture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.\n    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,\nfour are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said\nexclusive contracts with pay television networks are the\nemerging trend. \"Up until recently you could see any motion\npicture on any pay channel,\" Redstone said.\n    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios\nand plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.\n    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers\nwill be paid what is due for termination of its merger\nagreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. \"That will\nbe a company expense,\" Redstone said.\n    He said BankAmerica <BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries\nfrom lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr\nfinancing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.\n    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National\nbut 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "A senior British official said that\nprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger\nretaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the\nglobal trading system.\n    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if\nCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which\nwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian\ntextile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\"\n    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade\nMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the\ncommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.\n    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two\ndays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members\nof Congress.\n    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.\n    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in\nCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and the\nAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade\ndeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.\n    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to\nforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.\n    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone\nproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was\n51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.\n    \"The more united pressure there could be, the better,\" he\nsaid.\n    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to\navoid trade disputes.\n    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation\nearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and\nPortugal joined the community and its liberal imports\nregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.\n    \"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" he\nsaid, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on another\noccasion.\"\n    Channon added that \"There is increasing reesentment in\nEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure\nof unilaterally imposed deadlines.\"\n    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -\nalleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and\ntaxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the United States\nmust therefore learn to manage their relations better.\"\n    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate\nagainst a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.\ngoods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on\nTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.\n    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not\nby the United States, adding \"if the (trade) law is to be\ninterpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is\nto happen to the rest of us?\"\n   \n reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "TWA <TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT <PIE> SITUATION",
  "body": "Trans World Airlines Inc complicated\nthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy\nPiedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with\nPiedmont and USAir.\n    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street\nspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk\nSouthern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\nairlines.\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\nthe takeover arena.\n    \"We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA\ninto play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to\nmove onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWA\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\"\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\nrevealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show their\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a\ncredible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\n    \"I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values\nof airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\nthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\nshares.\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\nof Piedmont.\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\n    \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\nairlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\n    \"I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this\nway it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim.\n    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\nthe offer.\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>\nand still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.\n    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\noffer on price and financing concerns. \"It's littered with\ncontingencies and it doesn't even have a financing\narrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline.\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\nstrong contender with USAir's east coast route system and\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\n    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation\nsystem.\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Sales of new cars by the U.S. auto\nindustry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of\na year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp <GM> was an\nexception with an eight pct drop.\n    The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry\nfrom weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car\nmanufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month\nfrom last year.\n    GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months,\ntook only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28\nperiod compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the\nentire industry were depressed from the ending of major\nmarketing incentive campaigns.\n    At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co <F> said its car\nsales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp <C> was up\n11.3 pct.\n    The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the\nfull month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February,\nincluding imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.\n    Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold\nin the seven selling days of late February represented a\nseasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the\n556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.\n    Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,\nincluding 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a\nbreather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in\n1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of\nwidespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,\nanalysts said.\n    GM sales vice-president C.N. \"Bud\" Moore said in a\nstatement that his company's sales \"began their recovery from\nthe low point reached in January, and we expect the improvement\nto continue in coming months.\"\n    Anne Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber and Co,\ntold Reuters that GM's sales were weak, but added: \"I think\nsales will get better in the spring.\"\n    \"GM may make more production cuts in view of the weak\nsales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build\ninventories,\" she said.\n    In a further effort to revive sales, GM said its\nOldsmobile, Pontiac and Buick divisions would offer many of\ntheir new car lines through April 30 with discount loan\npackages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts\nto 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash\nrebates.\n    Among the smaller U.S.-based manufacturers, Japanese-owned\nAmerican Honda <HMC> said its late February car sales rose 96.2\npct from last year while Japanese-owned Nissan <NSANY> was up\n35.9 pct.\n    German-owned Volkswagen of America fell 42.5 pct, American\nMotors Corp <AMO> plunged 62.5 pct and Japan's Toyota <TOYOY>\nsold 1,082 domestic makes compared with none a year ago before\nit started domestic production.\n    Detroit's late February truck sales were generally positive\nwith GM up 10.9 pct, Ford up 48 pct, Chrysler gaining 46 pct\nand AMC's jeep sales off 4.0 pct.\n    Imported cars sales, released monthly, were estimated at\n219,300 in February, a 0.4 pct rise from last year and 28.3 pct\nof the overall car market. That was lower than January's 31.4\npct share but above the 26.3 pct share a year ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic\nproduct expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.\n    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that\ninflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy\nand said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's\ninflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.\n    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound\ndespite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in\ndebt plagued countries such as Brazil.\n    \"It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I\nthink it can be overplayed in terms of its impact,\" Crow told\nreporters.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked\nlenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that\nwould cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.\n    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other\nthan the American Air Filter business, make a public financing\nof more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently\noutstanding debt with the proceeds.\n    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional\nlenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty\nCorp, \"substantial amounts\" of institutional debt would be\nconverted to common stock of the restructured company.\n    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred\nstock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and\npreferred stock for common equity will cause a \"resulting\ndilution of the existing common stock,\" Allis-Chalmers said in\na statement.\n    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about\n15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing\npreferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.\n    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is\nbankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,\ncommon and preferred holders,and present and former employees.\n    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing \"appears to\nrepresent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the\nterms of the plan cannot be reached.\"\n    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was\nnot aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that\nwould result from the restructuring.\n    \"It is too early to talk about a charge\" because the plan\nmust still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.\n    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private\nlenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations\nincurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.\n    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees\nwould be made \"at substantially reduced levels.\"\n    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment\ncompanies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz\nof West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with\nbusinesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling\nand solid materials processing.\n    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to\nAC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.\n    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its\nsolid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.\nSolid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush\nstones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of\nAllis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.\n    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,\nwhich makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196\nmln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.\n    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,\nor 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,\nor 12.27 dlrs a share.\n    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4\nmln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs\nin 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a\nlarge volume of debt refinancing and growing integration\nbetween national and international markets, the OECD said.\n    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34\npct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in\nthe relative importance of the instruments used in\ninternational financing.\n    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and\neuro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing\nrose to their highest level this decade. The markets for\nfloating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.\n    The OECD said another striking feature of international\ncapital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of\nlending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,\nwhich accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.\n    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a\nnotable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing\nthrough the flotation of fixed-interest securities.\n    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new\ntechniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.\n    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of\nequity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a\nrapidly expanding market for euro-equities.\n    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers\nwas more than offset by a large volume of refinancing\noperations induced by improved market conditions and stronger\ndebt management policies. Growing integration with national\nmarkets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on\ninternational markets.\n    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market\nfor short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten\nissuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to\ntraditional forms of bank lending.\n    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a\npossible slowdown of international markets' expansion and\npossibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.\n    It said many market participants saw little scope for a\nfurther decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in\nthe pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.\n    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in\ndemand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers\nwould try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided\nby the market for euro-commercial paper.\n    \"It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market\nwill be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from\nlower-rated borrowers,\" the report said, adding that any major\nadvance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would\nrequire a significantly broader investor base.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "NYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES",
  "body": "Trading in energy futures on the New\nYork Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next\nfive to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing\nchairman Michel Marks.\n    \"Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous\nperiod of transition that will last five to 10 years,\" Marks\nsaid, adding that volume will soar, international participation\nwill increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil\ncompanies, and speculators will grow.\n    Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when\nboard elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman\nof a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.\n    \"The priority of the next 10 years is operational\nefficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product\ndevelopment,\" said Marks.\n    Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out\nof trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in\norder to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that\nare already planned.\n    Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by\nthe end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined\nproducts volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.\n    Much of the increased activity will come from the\ninternational sector, according to Marks. \"That's a huge growth\narea,\" he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign\nproducer countries to foreign independent operators.\n     He said it would be difficult to develop a futures\ncontract based on an internationally traded crude although he\npreviously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.\n    \"Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude\nbesides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task\" he said.\n     Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on\nan international product rather than an international crude\nwill be developed since the products market is more diverse. He\nsaid previously the exchange is studying the possibility of\ndeveloping a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.\n    Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the\nmajor oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and\ninstitutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,\nand insurance companies, Marks said.\n    \"The commodities markets have become financial markets and\nshould pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,\"\nMarks said.\n    He said speculators will increase their share of the energy\nfutures markets in the coming years from the current  share of\nabout 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70\npct share.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust\nNew York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.   \n    The study was likely to show substantial benefits from\ncontinuing the separation of commercial and investment banking,\nhe said.\n    Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker\nJim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would\nhurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds\nthat invest in securities.\n    \"It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax\non the saver and investor,\" Gerard said.\n    In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from the\nUnited States to other countries, he said.             \n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest\nrate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a\nthree month trading range which signals a bullish chart\nbreakout, financial analysts said.\n    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign\nthat the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may\nbe enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts\nsaid.\n    \"The market is paying more attention to the weakened state\nof the economy right now,\" said Refco analyst Mike Connery.\n    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory\norders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth\nwill be slow.\n    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the\nLombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production\nfigures also provided some support.\n    \"The domestic economies of the major trading partners of\nthe U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be\nforced to ease,\" thus paving the way for a more accomodative\nU.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First\nOptions of Chicago.\n    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade\ndeficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major\nindustrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.\n    \"The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for\nbonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather\nthan translate those into their own currencies and suffer\nexchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,\"\nMichael said.\n    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said\nsome of the late strength in the bond market resulted from\nbuying by Japanese interests.\n    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred\nafter the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.\n    \"The breakout is pretty important,\" said chartist Leslie\nKeefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. \"Not only did bonds\nclose above recent highs but they were also above the sideways\npattern we've been in for the last three months.\"\n    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the\nJune bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and\nthat the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.\n    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance\nwill be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, \"we still have\nthe April (1986) highs to contend with,\" which in the nearby\ncontract is 105-15/32.\n    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June\nT-bonds and \"there is an outside chance to reach 106.\"\n    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed\nfrom other technical indicators such as relative strength\nindexes and short-term momentum indicators.\n    \"Without them, sustained strength is in question,\" Keefe\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "President Reagan, fighting to regain\npublic confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal,\nadmitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an\narms-for-hostages deal and, \"It was a mistake.\"\n    \"When it came to managing the NSC (National Security\nCouncil) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its\nprevious track record,\" Reagan said in a television address to\nthe American people.\n    \"I have already begun correcting this,\" he added in his\nprepared remarks.\n    Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes\nof repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to\nlast week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret\nsale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed\ncontra rebels in Nicaragua.\n    Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he\nwaited for the truth to come out and admitted, \"I've paid a\nprice for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence.\"\n    He said that a few months ago, he told the American people\nhe did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert\noperation.\n    \"My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,\nbut the facts and the evidence tell me it is not,\" Reagan said.\n    \"There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a\nmistake,\" he said.\n    Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to\ndevelop relations with those who might assume leadership in a\npost-Khomeini government.\n    \"It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my\npersonal concern for the hostages spill over into the\ngeo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.\n    \"I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that\nI didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,\"\nhe said.\n    The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John\nTower, said Reagan's \"intense compassion\" for Americans being\nheld by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an\nunprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.\n    It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know\nor care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal\nactivities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which\nhatched the operation.\n    Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's\nrecommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, \"In fact,\nI'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in\neven better order.\"\n    He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican\nleader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped\nBaker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress,\n\"especially on foreign and national security policies.\"\n    He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci,\nwas rebuilding the national security staff \"with proper\nmanagement discipline.\"\n    Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now\nconsisted of new people.\n    He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee\nto head the CIA, \"understands the meaning of 'rule of law'\".\n    Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a\nmember of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts\nas a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.\n    But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC\nstaff itself from undertaking covert operations -- \"No ifs,\nands, or buts.\"\n    Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong\ndefense of his Iran policy.\n    In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called\ncharges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on\nterrorism \"utterly false.\"\n    As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union\nspeech, Reagan said that \"serious mistakes were made\" but\ndefended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.\n    By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that\nwas a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident\ndemeanor.\n    He said he took full responsibility for his own actions \"and\nfor those of my administration.\"\n    \"As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my\nknowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As\ndisappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the\none who must answer to the American people for this behavior,\"\nReagan said.\n    Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had\ncome from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies\naround the world -- \"and if we're reading the signals right,\neven from the Soviets.\"\n    His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet\nwillingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range\nnuclear missiles in Europe.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Talks on similar projects have been\nheld with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy\nIndustries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy\nIndustries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said.\n    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty\nfoot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,\nwhich would complete production.\n    \"We expect the successful cooperation between us and\nOnomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other\nJapanese shipbuilders in the future,\" Lo said.\n    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of\nshipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese\ntechnology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to\ncompetitors in Europe and South Korea.\n    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs\nsince beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands\nat about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly\nthree mln dlrs.\n    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest\nshipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun\ndiversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and\nother machinery.\n    \"We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,\"\nhe said.\n    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln\nU.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the\nprevious financial year. He estimated income would rise to more\nthan 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.\n    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead\nweight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships\nof 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.\n    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least\nuntil 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship\nrepairing was bright.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Oil and gas\naccount for 70 pct of export income.\n    The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections,\nSuharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay\nincreases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending.\n    The government has also recently increased transport fares\nand frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the\nsecond year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8\npct.\n    The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio\nwidened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986.\n    Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for\nalmost a third of the 1987/88 budget.\n    A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross\ndomestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when\nSuharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered\nnil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in\n1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year.\n    In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom\nyears of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct,\nthe government is now relying more on foreign borrowings.\n    Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its\nshare of new projects being built with overseas money, because\nit cannot afford even to meet local costs.\n    In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans\ntotalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37\nbillion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the\ncountry now ranks sixth among Third World debtors.\n    A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December\nwas followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr\nloan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments.\n    Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr\nloan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which\nwould otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are\non the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a\ntotal 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation.\n    U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that\neconomic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's\nfundamental stability.\n    The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so\nfar avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem\ncountries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting\nunemployment could start causing severe social strains unless\nit is tackled.\n    It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that\nunless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach\nwhat it termed \"unacceptable levels.\"\n    Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of\nlast year, but those considered underemployed number around 35\npct.\n    What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute\nwithin Suharto's government, with his Western-trained\ntechnocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported\nby the international financial community.\n    But another group supports a protected economy, with more\nimport substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said.\n    The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the\ndollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is\ncurrently working on a series of measures to further encourage\nforeign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector.\n    The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's\nability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say.\n    So far, despite three packages of economic measures over\nthe past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that\nare linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by\nbusiness associates, diplomats and bankers say.\n    Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on\nmonopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that\nSuharto is serious about tackling the country's problems.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE",
  "body": "The easing of rules governing overseas use\nof the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but\nhas failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,\nbond managers and traders said.\n    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in\nthe Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping\nthe yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the\nJapanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the\nfreer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese\naccord to internationalise the yen, they said.\n    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese\ninterest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily\nwith Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other\ncurrencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85\npct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.\n    \"The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are\nonly after attractive money,\" one bond trader said.\n    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous\nyear, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the\ntotal Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of\nDaiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.\n    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among\nJapanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the\nprestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort\nto \"harakiri\" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.\n    But the fever continues and the number of offerings could\ndouble again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko\nSecurities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.\n    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by\nJapanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting\nperiod the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is\nstrong, he added.\n    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more\nattractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency\ninvestments, traders said.\n    \"Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing\n(in yen),\" said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond\ndepartment.\n    While few foreigners are interested in the secondary\nmarket, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life\ninsurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the\nbonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer\nlittle currency risk, traders said.\n    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting\nperiod before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from\n180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that\nreflow was fairly small.\n    \"We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the\nEuroyen market,\" he said.\n    One trader said that although demand from Japanese\ninvestors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said\nmany investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.\nInterest rates decline further.\n    To encourage further international use of the yen, the\nministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen\ncommercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying\ndemand from potential borrowers.\n    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit\nnon-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next\nfew months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic\nparticipation in the market for some time to come. Japanese\nbanks object to the short-term paper market which they see\nencroaching on their business territory.\n    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more\ndemand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift\ninto shorter-term securities if need be.\n    \"Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,\" one bond\nmanager said. If more financial instruments were available,\nthere might be more trades in yen, he added.\n    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though\nsome recent issues which are callable in three years work as if\nthey had shorter maturities, traders said.\n    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond\nmaturities within a few months.\n    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities\nare giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules\ngoverning international transactions of the yen. But freer use\nof the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the\nJapanese currency, he said. \"If exporters or importers can raise\nfunds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the\nJapanese yen as a settlement currency,\" he added.\n    The Finance Ministry official said the government must\nconstantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of\nborrowers and investors. \"No major market can keep its status\nwithout change,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.\n    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of\n42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a\none-for-five bonus issue.\n    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus\nissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.\n    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK>\nis to report its 1986 results on Friday.\n    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more\nthan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to\n12 pct.\n    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs\nfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.\n    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner\nreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,\nHongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the\nHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by\nnearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.\n    \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,\nas their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at Mansion\nHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.\n    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose\nby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.\n    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of\nthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five\npct in 1985.\n    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received\non loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,\nbut interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and\nHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking\nsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.\n    The strength of the real-estate market was another major\nincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance property\ndevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.\n    \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage\nbusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China group\nand other foreign banks,\" one analyst said.\n    The high level of activity on the capital and equities\nmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong\nBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and\nCo>, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting as\nfinancial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said.\n    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr\nflotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong\nBank owned 30 pct at the time.\n    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return\nfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake\nin <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two\nEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.\n    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will\nnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.\n    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced\nneed to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was much\nlower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong\nSecurities Co Ltd. \"Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to\n2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\"\n    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the\nbank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its\nshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities\nAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She\nforecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.\n    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its\n51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have\nimproved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986\nfourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs\nfrom 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145\nmln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN",
  "body": "The highly visible drama involving the\nyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Japanese creditor banks are close to a\ndecision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they\nwill transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable\ndebts owed by developing nations, international financial\nsources told Reuters.\n    Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the\nfirm set up before the end of the month, they said.\n    The scheme is intended to improve financial management at\nthe banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts\nturning bad, the sources said.\n    Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would\nindefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68\nbillion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese\ncreditors to finalise the project, the sources said.\n    Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid\na debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.\n    There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and\nperhaps as many as 28, they said.\n    About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans\ntotalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about\n15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.\n    The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the\nCaribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.\n    The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with\nparticipating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.\n    The firm will then use the funds to buy from its\nstock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign\nloans which are potentially bad, the sources said.\n    The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.\n    Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to\ndebt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.\n    The financial sources said interest payments to the firm\nwould not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have\nasked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss\nreserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.\n    A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it\nmay encourage new lending to developing countries.\n    The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up\nto five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled\ncountries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting\nfor one pct of the loans.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT",
  "body": "The outlook for the West\nGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross national\nproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel\nUniversity's Institute for World Economy said.\n    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading\neconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic\nthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recently\nreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.\n    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export\noutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's\nstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.\n    \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in\nall, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise\nin exports can be expected.\"\n    The institute said past experience has shown West German\nexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by\ncutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting\ntheir product ranges.\n    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in\neconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\nthis year.\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\npolicy, the institute said.\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\nagreed reductions in working hours.\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\nacceleration of inflation.\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\nglobal recession. It said central banks in industrialized\ncountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal\nReserve Board's expansionary course.\n    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead\neventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.\nPolicy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks\nwere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could\naggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as\nincrease protectionism around the world.\n    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the\nnegative effects of the global synchronization of monetary\npolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of\ngrowth at home.\n    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that\nfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes\nshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and\nwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than\nin 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary\npressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply\nto about four pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS",
  "body": "Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its\neconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington\nto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining\nrestrictions two weeks ago.\n    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown\nof the figure, saying it takes into account a number of\nhypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland's efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\n\"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\nof the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\nSolidarity.\"\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\nfinancial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\nforeign economic partners.\"\n    He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\n    \"As a major superpower the United States can influence\ninternational organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Britain had a visible trade deficit of\n2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised\ndeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official\nstatistics show.\n    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central\nStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in\ndeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third\nquarter shortfall of 930 mln.\n    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3\nbillion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and\na 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.\n    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the\nfourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an\nestimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter\nfigure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.\n    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to\n1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.\n    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.\n    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter\nwas due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and\na reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO\nsaid.\n    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg\nlower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade\nincreased by 2.1 billion.\n    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.\n    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,\nparticularly for the most recent quarters are liable to\nsubstantial revisions as later information becomes available.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

This follows a steady decline in the call\nmoney rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance\nMinistry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.\n    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of\nthe meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five\nindustrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored\nconsiderable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks\nof turbulence.\n    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February\n23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily\ndown to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,\nwhere it has now stabilised.\n    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb\nliquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.\n    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage\npoint, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has\nremained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight\npct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.\n    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at\n8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.\n    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase\nrate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while\nusing the intervention rate to set the floor.\n    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said\nthat he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers\nsaid any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come\nwhen the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,\nalthough an earlier cut could not be excluded.\n   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early\nas tomorrow morning, banking sources said.\n    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an\nacceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging\nthe authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also\npointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving\nscope for a small fall in rates.\n    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished\n1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,\nrising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the\nBank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with\nquarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.\n    Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but\nbegan to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new\nissue circulated.\n    When the deal was launched the major players quickly\nsuspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own\nissues, brokers said. \"We just don't know where the market is\ngoing,\" said a European banker.\n    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low\nof 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10\nbasis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister\nbanks in the Bank of China group.\n    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was\nlaunched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the\nmarket at that time.\n    But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the\npresent market conditionS, \"the timing was just not right.\"\n    \"If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues\nnow, and then the market would be all right,\" another dealer\nsaid.\n    \"But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic,\" he said.\n\"The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as\nwhat happened after the DKB and Morgan deals.\"\n    Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to\nrecruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the\ngroup has not yet been finalised.\n    \"Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the\ndeal,\" said a dealer. \"But there are other considerations such as\nrelationship.\" He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.\n    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers\ndecided to shut down if they were willing to join the new\nissue.\n    \"Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese\nentity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue,\" he\nsaid.\n    Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead\nmanagers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The Saudi figures include a\n200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.\n    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was\nestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in\nearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share\nof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.\n    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some\nOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,\nboth substantially under quota in February and early March.\n    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to\n180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.\n    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s\nprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any\nshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.\n    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down\nfrom 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.\n    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny\ngrades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes\nfrom the U.K. North Sea.\n    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in\nmln bpd -\n COUNTRY        CURRENT        FEBRUARY    QUOTA\n ALGERIA        0.64           0.64        0.635\n ECUADOR        0.26           0.26        0.210\n GABON          0.15           0.15        0.152\n INDONESIA      1.16           1.16        1.133\n IRAN           1.80           2.20        2.255\n IRAQ           1.75           1.75        1.466\n KUWAIT         1.15           1.40        0.948\n LIBYA          0.95           0.95        0.948\n NIGERIA        1.00           1.14        1.238\n QATAR          0.18           0.23        0.285\n SAUDI ARABIA   3.10           3.50        4.133\n UAE            1.10           1.15        0.902\n VENEZUELA      1.50           1.50        1.495\n TOTAL          14.7           16.0        15.8\n REUTER\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Baker said it believes the vote\nwas overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.\n    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the\nmerger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were \"more\nburdensome\" than those of the consent decree themselves.\n    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would\nreduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs\nor three pct.\n    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of\nthe units named in the consent decree.\n    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of\nits directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to\nlive up to the merger agreement or \"substantial\" monetary\ndamages it did not name.\n    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best\ninterests of shareholders of both companies.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

However, the introduction of\nthe new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.\n    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to\nsell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.\n    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,\nfinance director John Edwards said.\n    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards\nsaid the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German\ncompetitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6\nhad also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would\nrestrict the car's price.\n    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a\n12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of\nits receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.\n    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10\npct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct\nof net sales and training two pct.\n    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the\nother half. The firm is in early stages of considering the\nbuilding of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,\nbut Egan said this would take at least another three years\n    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last\nquoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after\nreporting 1986 results which were in line with market\nexpectations, dealers said.\n REUTER...\n\u0003",

  "body": "Enzon Inc said a new\ntreatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has\nrestored the functioning of the immune system in the first two\nchildren that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine\ndeaminase.\n    The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency\ndisease, or \"bubble boy disease\"\n    Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that\nhampers the development of the immune system. It has killed\nmost of its victims before adulthood.\n    Children with the disease are consigned to live in a\nsterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid\ninfection, the company said.\n    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,\nshowed that two children suffering from the disease were\ntreated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of\nserious infection during that time, the company said. The\nresults were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine\nDeaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the\nimmune system.\n    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme\nwith a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to\ndisguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,\npreventing rejection.\n    \"Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function\noccurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of\nT-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before\ntreatment with PEG-ADA had begun,\" the study said.\n    \"The children are now more active and have begun to gain\nweight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very\npoor in comparison to normal children of the same age,\" the\nstudy, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca\nBuckley, said.\n    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of\nthe disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow\ntransplants, but for most, donors are not available or\ntransplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other\ndiseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by\nintroducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS",
  "body": "Congressional ire is rising against\nthe multinational development banks which make loans to help\nother countries produce goods in direct competition with\nbeleagured U.S. farmers and miners.\n    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last\nyear and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing\nto hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other\ndevelopment banks if the money is used to subsidize production\nor to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.\n     \"American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign\nagriculture and mineral production that is often in direct\ncompetition with our producers,\" Senator Don Nickles, an\nOklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators\nseeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.\n    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican\nfrom Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly\nlimit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they\nmake any loans to help developing countries produce surplus\ncommodities or minerals.\n    Current law requires that the United States vote against\nsuch loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately\napproved by the banks.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.\npolicy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised\nat two Senate committee hearings last week.\n    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign\nOperations, \"As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production\nof commodities in oversupply.\"\n    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to\nArgentina last year to help it increase its agricultural\nexports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.\n    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such\nas a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock\nexports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at\nlow interest rates for agriculture.\n    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three\ntimes over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.\nfunding of development banks by the amount of these loans.\n    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,\nthe restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a\nprovision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared\nCongress.\n    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural\nInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote\nagainst loans designed to increase production of surplus\ncommodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would\nhave to prove that the production, marketing and export of the\ncommodities could be handled without government subsidy.\n    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United\nStates would not increase or replenish funds for that\ninstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.\n    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by\nconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.\nfunding for these international development banks.\n    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised\nsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.\n    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie\nits hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be\ninstances in which a country needed the money to continue its\nmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.\n    Baker said the United States would continue to use its\nleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization\nmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.\n    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho\nand Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it\nfaces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has\nblocked its consideration by the House in the past.\n    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any\nrelated legislation this year, an aide said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER",
  "body": "Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> earnings\nfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market\nconditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to\ndifferent accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.\n    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,\nwhile the additional effect of currency movements reduced the\ncontribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.\n    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the\nyear to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with\nlower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by\nvolume.\n    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at\nthe top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading\nPlc <SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg\nfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a\ngeneral collapse in exploration and production volumes was\npartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\nstg from 205 mln in 1985.\n    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\ncurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\nresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\nforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\nWedd noted.\n    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\nperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\nimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the high\nrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\n    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\nfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\nhigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\ntypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\nlag, analysts said.\n    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\nquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\n    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\nthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\nadded.\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\nU.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently pretty\nflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no\nmassive upturn,\" he said.\n    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North\nSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.\n    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. \"If\nyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything,\" he\nnoted.\n    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\n(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\nbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.\n    This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the\nlower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\nmarginal production shutting down. \"OPEC has done pretty\nextraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\"\nhe added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE",
  "body": "Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's\ndecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings\nbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government's\ndetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflation\ndespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.\n    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one\npercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess\nliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.\n    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the\nBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to\nchoke off money supply growth.\n    \"I think it's a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said.\n\"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates\nand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\"\n    \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They know\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\nand bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added.\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\nraising interest rates.\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\nexports less competitive.\n    The government says industry's competitiveness is also\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\nway above that of Spain's major trading partners in the\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\n    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\nsacrifices.\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\nmoney market too hard.\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\ntoday's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since\nthe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.\n    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in\nany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate\nbanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.\n    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the\npublication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers\nsay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,\ninevitably, push lending rates higher.\n    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which\nbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect\ntomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month\nthat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher\ninterest rates.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "CONGRESS EYES LOANS THAT AID U.S. COMPETITORS",
  "body": "Congressional ire is rising against\nthe multinational development banks which make loans to help\nother countries produce goods in direct competition with\nbeleagured American farmers and miners.\n    With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year\nand a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to\nhold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development\nbanks if the money is used to subsidize production or to\nproduce goods already in oversupply around the world.\n    \"American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign\nagriculture and mineral production that is often in direct\ncompetition with our producers,\" Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma\nRepublican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support\nfor his legislation to limit these loans.\n    Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican\nfrom Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly\nlimit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they\nmake any loans to help developing countries produce surplus\ncommodities or minerals.\n    Current law requires the United States to vote against such\nloans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.\npolicy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised\nat two Senate committee hearings last week.\n    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign\nOperations, \"as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production\nof commodities in oversupply.\"\n    The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to\nArgentina last year to help it increase its agricultural\nexports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.\n    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such\nas a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock\nexports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at\nlow interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine\nloan was \"really the only one you can point to and criticize.\"\n    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three\ntimes over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.\nfunding of development banks by the amount of these loans.\n    Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions\nwere weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing\nU.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.\n    This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural\nInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote\nagainst loans designed to increase production of surplus\ncommodities and minerals.\n    Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the\nproduction, marketing and export of the commodities could be\nhandled without government subsidy.\n    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United\nStates would not increase or replenish funds for that\ninstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.\n    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by\nconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.\nfunding for these international development banks.\n    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised\nsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.\n    Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker\nat the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, \"Many say the\nbanks are financing competition for American jobs.\"\n    She recommended that the United States use its\nparticipation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans\nas a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.\n    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie\nits hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be\ninstances in which a country needed the money to continue its\nmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.\n    Baker said the United States would continue to use its\nleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization\nmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as\nmuch as they want, but they have to eventually address this\nproblem,\" David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.\n    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and\nAgriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the\nsoybean loan, Haggard said.\n    \"I don't know if USDA is really very serious about\naddressing the soybean loan problem,\" he said.\n    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA\nleaders refused to change their official position on the  loan\n-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.\n    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,\nR-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a\n5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.\n    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed\nproposals have but said, \"in all honesty, we do not want to see\nthe farm bill be torn apart.\"\n    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to\na market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could\nchange the loan without new legislation.\n    Making the loan partially in certificates which would not\nhave to be paid back would be one option, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Securities and Exchange Commission\nchairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping\ninsider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with\njurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about\nconditions on Wall Street.\n    \"Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in\nthe process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations\nhave become easy prey,\" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the\nchairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the\nstart of a hearing on SEC activities.\n    \"Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the\ncurrent scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,\"\nMarkey said. \"The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania\nis particularly distressing.\"\n    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis\nLevine and others was a warning that those who engage in\ninsider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high\nfines and disbarment from the securities industry.\n    \"Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been\ninhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky\nand others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing\nthrough to legitimate investors and traders,\" Shad said in his\nstatement.\n    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or\nless of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have\nincreased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past\nfive years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.\n    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought\nthe tender offer process needed reform including earlier\ndisclosure of takeover attempts.\n    N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee\nRepublican, said he was introducing legislation to create a\nfive member commission to study the securities industry for a\nyear and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.\nCommission members would be appointed by the SEC.\n    \"Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of\nillegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy\nof existing surveillance systems and government oversight\noperations. The commission would advise Congress as to what\nadditional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed\nto combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,\"\nRinaldo said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN",
  "body": "Personal taxation has emerged as the\nmajor economic issue in Finnish general elections later this\nmonth, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards\nindirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more\nmarket-oriented banking practices, economists say.\n    Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's\nsecond largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to\njoin a coalition government which is still likely to be\ndominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi\nSorsa.\n    But the economists point out that Conservative economic\npolicies differ only slightly from the governments', and that\ntrade with the Soviet Union will not be affected.\n    Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the\nConservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about\na shift from direct to indirect taxation.\n    The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has\nembarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation,\nwhich is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The\nopposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over\nhow to regain lost state revenues.\n    One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax\nexemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.\n    Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki\n(KOP), told Reuters \"We want to be more free in setting interest\nrates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual\ninvestors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a\nsystem with taxation of real interest gains.\"\n    Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on\ninterest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said\nthis had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering\ntougher inter-bank competition.\n    A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation\nwas too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a\nConservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.\n    \"It would probably result in new practices that have been\nseen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in\nFinland,\" he said, in a reference to money market instruments.\n    All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been\ncareful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.\nMoscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years\nago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has\nnow moderated its stance, political analysts say.\n    Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter\nsystem, and is balanced under long-term accords.\n    In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth\n30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been\ndeclining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which\naccounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.\n    The bankers said taxation had become the major economic\ntheme of the campaign because there were few other issues.\n    Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in\n1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of\nthe workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.\n    The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign\ntrade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to\n5.04 billion markka.\n    Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the\nlargest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of\nthe vote. They currently hold 57 seats.\n    The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is\nalso expected to hold on to its 37 seats.\n    But increased Conservative support and a decline for the\nCommunists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives\ninto government. They currently hold 44 seats.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "A study of salmonella poisoning has\nuncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding\nantibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that\ncan infect humans and resist medicines.\n    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control\ntracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is\nresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the\nresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote\nthe growth of cattle.\n    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of\nantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\nhumans.\n    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\nfor their illness.\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\nraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the\nmajority of cases appear to have been caused by eating\nhamburger that was at least partially cooked.\"\n    The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are\na major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections\nin humans, and that these infections are associated with\n(antibiotic) use on farms.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987",
  "body": "Leaks of a major Dutch official\neconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate\nreduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this\nyear, political and market sources say.\n    Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness\nthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage\nincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some\ncalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.\n    But whatever the government's response, the central bank\nwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.\n    The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)\npublishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will\nalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and\nthe economy.\n    Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate\nreflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch\neconomic growth was now seen around one pct.\n    Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the\ndecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West\nGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,\nPierson said in its February economic outlook.\n    The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct\ngrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of\n2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.\n    The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the\ngovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal of\nreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.\n    Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central\nbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if\nnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.\n    Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised\nthe guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in\nlast January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and\nexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.\n    But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy\nhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the\ndollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.\n    Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not\nto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead\nlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.\n    Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move\nsaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on\nthe money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the\nmoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already\nfar below the market rates.\"\n    Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of\nthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest\nrate policies serve that goal.\n    Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands\nrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold\nto take profits.\n    Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would\nreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more\ndificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch\ninterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued\ncompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.\n    Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision\nnot to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson\nwarned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.\n    Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry\nand the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having\nsaid before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower\nDutch rates but that the Germans should move first.\n    One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down\nto reduce the government debt burden.\n    A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were\nneeded but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between\nthe ministry and the central bank. \"The cabinet's policy is\nsteady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT",
  "body": "The Bank of England again fought against\nmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate\ncut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise\nin its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.\n    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct\nof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued\nto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and\nthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.\n    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can\nstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want\nto.\n    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants\nrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when\nit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to\nrelieve a money market shortage.\n    \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said\nStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.\n\"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\"\n    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by\nany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had\ninhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came\nstrongly into the pound.\n    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London\nclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60\nmarks, up from 2.8720/50.\n    \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that\nrates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist\nat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.\n    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the\nbase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.\n    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be\nconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating\nrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.\n    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said\nPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.\n    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of\na Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and\ndisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to\nhold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback\nfor bonds, Fellner said.\n    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most\nforecasts say it will be this year.\n    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to\noil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.\n    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set\nthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.\n    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable\nrate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.\n    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least\na proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term\ncapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.\n    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet\nthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and\ncurrent political upheavals in Washington.\n    The Bank may want to see another few points on the\ntrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\nEngland,\" he added.\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\nharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\nbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

This can be done in one way\nonly, through the reduction of subsidies.\"\n    But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branch\nministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market,\nmake foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentives\nto export-oriented industry and encourage private business.\n    Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on the\neconomy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to the\nsuppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law.\n    He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add to\nits problems in trying to regain markets and support from\nWestern creditors even after Washington lifted remaining\nrestrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading status\nlast month.\n     Western officials say Polish goods have to be more\ncompetitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars and\nprotectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors.\n    Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solving\nsome of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billion\ndlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports,\nKaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role.\n    \"I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprises\nactive in export-oriented business if such operators are\nsuccessfully convinced that the policy towards the (private)\nsector is stabilised,\" he said.\n    Poland already has a more developed private sector than\nmost other East European countries.\n    Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listed\neasier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, access\nto investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty to\nincrease competitivity of prices.\n    He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bank\nand International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hoping\nto gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a \"vicious circle.\"\n    Creditors wanted proof that the policies were directed\ntowards improving exports, but in order to fulfil their\nexpectations Poland first needed fresh inputs, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Kistler\nsaid its counter proposal to merge with Baker International\nCorp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the\nbest interests of both companies.\n    \"Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is\ngood for both companies,\" Kistler said of the proposed merger\nthat would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service\ncompany. \"We're working very hard on this merger.\"\n    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting\nto vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11\nto give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.\n    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern\nabout a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would\nrequire Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and\nsubmersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to\nterminate the proposed merger.\n    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two\ncompanies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses\nbefore signing the decree.\n    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the\ncounter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state\ncourt to force to Hughes to complete the merger.\n    \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might\nbe imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous\nabout what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explaining\nwhy Hughes had made the counter proposal.\n    \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did not\naccept our proposal.\"\n    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was not\na factor\" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal\non the table.\n    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.\n    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a\ncompromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.\n    The Justice Department in January said it would block the\nHughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both\ncompanies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide\nfor the sale of the assets after the merger took place.\n    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because\nits was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker should\ninstead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the\nmerger is finalized and given government approval.\n    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable\nbuyers within a specified period of time after the decree is\napproved, a federal trustee would become responsible for\nfinding a buyer.\n    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take\nup to 10 years to complete the sales.\n    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might\nbe required by the government's conditions to license some of\nits technology to any purchaser of the assets.\n    Baker said last night in a statement that the required\nassets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,\nrepresenting about three pct of the revenues of the combined\ncompanies.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The French government is to\nsell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe\nGenerale <STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary <Societe Generale\nAlsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL\nofficials said.\n    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the\nleading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,\nBelgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.\n    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share\noffer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance\nMinister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.\n    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later\nthis year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the\nbank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.\n    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated\ngroup profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160\nmln this year and 159 mln in 1985.\n    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital\nincrease to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln\nfrancs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,\ngiving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.\n    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in\nline with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a\nregional operation, Geronimus said.\n    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around\n30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten\npct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees\nwith the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share\nreserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operation\nand anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said.\n    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of\n120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.\n    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce\nits existing strong points, with no major projects planned\napart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.\n    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the\nfirst foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its\nStrasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign\nbanking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.\n    The government's banking adviser for the operation was\n<Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere>, BPGF, owned by French\nfinancier Pierre Moussa's <Pallas> group, assisted by Britain's\n<Hambros Bank Ltd>.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,\nFrance, Japan, West Germany and Canada.\n    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise\nnumerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment\ntoward slowing the growth of federal spending.\n    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National\nProduct were declining and would continue to drop, he said.\n    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign\ncapital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep\ninterest rates stable.\n    \"This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.\nSooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive\nfederal spending,\" he said.\n    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the\nmain objective of the Fed, Johnson said.\n    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of\nexchange rates was needed for long-term growth.\n    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against \"quick fix\"\nsolutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation\nor protectionist trade legislation.\n    \"What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy\nreturns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine\neconomic growth,\" he said.\n    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow\nfor its gradual resolution over time.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "A reduction of the U.S. federal budget\ndeficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge\ntrade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.\n    Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,\nYeutter said \"Capital and trade flows are clearly\ninter-releated now.\n    \"Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the\ntrade deficit down.\"\n    He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between\nthe two deficits.\n    Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.\nbudget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas\ninvestors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser\nextent, other U.S. securities as well.\n    \"We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr\ntrade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,\"\nYeutter said.\n    He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and\nfocus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary\npolicies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and\nthe establishment of a \"level playing field\" for trade.\n    The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve\nunder Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the\ntrade situation by getting interest rates down.\n    On the fiscal side, Yeutter said \"the budget deficit is\nstill our biggest problem\" and there has not been enough\nprogress toward reducing that deficit.\n    In the international area, he said that \"our major trading\npartners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.\"\nCommenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr\ntrade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said \"Japan is\njust not doing the job on the import side.\"\n    Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the\ndollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of\nEconomic Affairs Robert Ortner.\n    In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored\nmeeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels\nwas fairly priced against most European currencies, but that\nthe yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.\n    \"The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the\nend,\" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and\nother nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.\ntrade deficit, \"the dollar will be the equalizer.\"\n    Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and\nany resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation\nor trade restrictions poses real dangers.\n    He said \"there's relatively little that Congress can do to\nlegislate a solution to the trade problem.\"\n    Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by\nU.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.\n    \"There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our\ntrading partners to retaliate against unfair trade\nlegislation,\" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is\nessential in solving international trade problems.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN",
  "body": "The highly visible drama involving the\nyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER...\n\u0003",

  "body": "Australia accused the U.S. of increasing\nprotectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to\nWashington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules\non agricultural trade.\n    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a\nspecial annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.\n    \"Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing\nU.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by\nactions which in fact increased protection in trade in\nagriculture,\" the Australian delegation said in a statement.\n    \"The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic\nflaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,\" Arnott told the\nmeeting.\n    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a\njustification for \"dubious protective measures\" by the U.S. He\nlisted a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to\nclose the U.S. sugar market to imports.\n    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to\nimpose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic\nsupport programs. This covered imports of dairy products,\npeanuts, cotton and sugar.\n    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the\nGATT, told Reuters: \"These charges have been made since the very\nbeginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural\npolicy, part of our law when we joined the GATT\".\n    \"We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the\nUruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with\ntheir programs. We can negotiate them all,\" Samuels added.\n    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay\nround of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.\nBargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,\ntourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as\nmanufactured goods.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> expects\ncurrency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S. Sales in\n1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in\n1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said.\n    Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S.\nMarket as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it would\nbe able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales.\n    In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG <NSUG.F>,\ndelivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outside\nof West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told a\nregular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce.\n    Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally become\nmore difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and\nfiercer competition in the region.\n    Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales. But he said\ncar sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined would\nprobably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record\n2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passed\ntheir peak for this business cycle.\n    Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growth\nwere becoming apparent on the VW group's most important markets\nbut there were no grounds for great worries.\n    The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, had\nentered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incoming\norders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.\n    Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also said\nVW currently had no plans for further increases in its\nworkforce.\n    He told the plant's workforce that an\ninternationally-active company like VW must be able to adjust\nto changed economic conditions and manage situations in which\nunfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial\nmaneuver.\n    Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share in\norder to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of\nits foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East.\n    This could only be done if capital-intensive plants were\nused as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were\nraised through comprehensive training and if working hours were\narranged so that expensive production plants operated as\nefficiently and soundly as possible.\n    The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to push\nfor a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germany\nindustry this year.\n    Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told the\nsame Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35\nhours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.\n    He said the works council was prepared to negotiate on\nmaking working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both\nthe company and the workforce.\n    A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 for\na 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in a\ncompromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each\ncompany in the industry to decide, in consultation with the\nworkforce, how the reductions should be made.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "A House Agriculture Committee meeting\nlater today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a\ndebate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or\n\"de-coupling,\" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who\noppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources\nsaid.\n    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year\n0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter\nwheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\nweek's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\nnecessary.\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\nshould be extended to other crops.\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\nchanges in the farm bill.\n    \"Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\ntiming,\" a congressional staff member said.\n    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\namendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\nfeedgrains.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT <PIE>",
  "body": "Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for\nUSAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,\nwhich was being courted by USAir.\n    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4\nbillion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\naccepting the bid.\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\nit would be taken over.\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will\nsucceed.\n    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\nSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\nleast likely to be bought.\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\ncontingencies.\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\n    \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\n    \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\nabout six dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\nacquired separately.\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\nwork,\" said one analyst.\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\nanalysts said.\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\nfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged\ninto TWA.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING",
  "body": "Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman\nsaid the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd\nceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been\ndelayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec\nprices.\n    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from\nJamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in\nFebruary, Opec had underproduced partly because members were\nstrictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they\nwere resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official\nprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\"\nhe said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they\nare committed to making the accord work,\" he said.\n    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He\nsaid the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these\nfigures.\n    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated\nthat Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he\nsaid; \"That could well be correct.\"\n    Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying\ngroup output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it\ngave no figures.\n    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output\nmay have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.\n    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around\n16 mln bpd.\n    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8\nmln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.\n    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all\nproduced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said\nit would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December\npact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.\n    Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that\nin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238\nmln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln\nallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.\n    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his\ncountry were coming under price pressure because they were\ncurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and\nthe United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.\n    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that\ndemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons\nand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.\n    \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is\nnow firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he\nexpected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after\nearly April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand\nfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.\n    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela\nand Indonesia were having less problems with output than\nproducers like his own country because they exported oil\nproducts.\n    Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec\npricing system, he said.\n    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift\nsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks\nand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually\nhave to buy Opec oil.\n    \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)\nthey will realise they should buy now instead of paying more\nlater on,\" he said.\n    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being\npressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was\nimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,\nflexible and under constant review, not only when the market\nseemed weak.\n    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation\nministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that\nsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority\nfor Opec at the moment.\n    \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is\nworking, not dealing with a differential of cents between\ngrades.\"\n    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over\nthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Top U.S. and European farm trade and\ngovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform of\nworld agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply\nimbalance.\n    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here\ndemonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for\nan urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and\nproduction.\n    \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and\nharmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the\ndisruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of\nprotection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation\nbecome more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy\nAdministrator William Bailey said.\n    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which\nends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to\nadjust its policies to the changing market environment.\n    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalance\nand tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\nJean-Claude Paye said.\n    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade, he noted.\n    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint\nreduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures\nto help farmers in unprofitable areas.\n    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm\nprices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and\ninstead help farmers through income support and adjustment\naids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of\nCargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.\n    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German\nChancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take\ngreater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.\n    However, \"differentiated policy treatment is required\" to\ntake account of large disparities in the situation around the\nEC, he said.\n    \"Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy\nand will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the\nCommunity,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Gaviria said lower\ncoffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs\nin revenues for 1987.\n    Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american\nbank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of\n3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,\nwhich he said was approved.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "HUGHES <HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT",
  "body": "A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed\nHughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a\nproposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>, Wall\nStreet analysts said.\n    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was\noff. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from\nHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said\nit was still interested in the merger.\n    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its\ntroubles could make it a takeover candidate.\n    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas\ninvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters\nhe is not interested.\n    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities\nand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in\nsome publicly traded company. He declined to identify the\ntarget other than to rule out Hughes.\n    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes\nturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of\nHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the\nHughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.\n    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a\nmerger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,\nanalysts said no one could be certain where the situation was\ngoing.\n    \"I think the merger is not going through,\" said Phil Pace,\nanalyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger \"lost a\nlot of its appeal\" when the U.S. Department of Justice required\nthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.\n    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of\nthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said \"30 to 40\npct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\"\n    \"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\"\nsaid James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\n\"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but\nwhether they will alter their position, I don't know.\n    \"It's getting a little confusing,\" said James Carroll,\nanalyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited\nby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger \"tend to be weak.\"\nHughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it\nwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,\nthe projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer\nperiod of time.\n    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the\ncompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker\napparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.\n    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln\ndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling\nReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be\nsaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.\n    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first\nsigned \"the outlook for the industry has improved materially.\"\nHughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry\nis lifting.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the \nrecovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas\ncontracts between producers and pipelines.\n    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment\nperiod. It also put out an alternative policy statement by\nCommissioner Charles Stalon.\n    FERC said in a press release that \"the proposed policy\nstatement estblishes an exception to the commission's general\npolicy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be\nrecovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates.\"\n    FERC added that \"specifically, in cases where pipelines\nassume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the\ncommission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the\nremaining costs through their demand rates.\"\n    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming\nexisting contracts to help spread the impact of these\ntake-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.\n    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said \"this proposal\nrepresents the commission's sincere attempt to help the\nindustry through this difficult period of transition to a more\ncompetitive market.\"\n    Hesse said \"it is my hope that our proposed policy will\nencourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay\ncontractual disputes that have impeded the industry's\ntransition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to\nthe industry that we get this problem behind us.\"\n reuter\n\u0003",

Glenn\nEnglish (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support\nan amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm\n(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop\nwinter and spring wheat.\n    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original\nproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987\nwheat only. That provision was later broadened by the\nsubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.\n    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still\ncollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed\nuntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill\nand 0/92.\n    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program\nfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential\nfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,\nand by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.\n    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time\nto study the implications of a broad 0/92.\n    \"The timing (of the proposal) is off,\" said one aide to a\nHouse Agriculture committee member.\n    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a\nbroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House\nAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make\nspending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part\nof an overall deficit reduction package.\n    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley\n(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may\nexceed one billion dlrs.\n    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the\nCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration\nestimate it would result in significant budget savings.\n    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all\n1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5\nbillion dlrs over five years.\n    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the\napproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.\n    Some officials said it already is late for implementation\nof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for\nwheat and feedgrains.\n    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either\nwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Farmers and others in\nagribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by\ntrading in option markets,\" the paper, written by Clemson\nUniversity professor Kandice Kahl, said.\n    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the\nbenefits of price support programs without entailing the cost\nto taxpayers.\n    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy \"put\" options in order to\nobtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private\nseller of the option contract.\n    \"This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows\nhim to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,\nby foregoing his option,\" Kahl said.\n    Interest in promoting understanding of options trading\namong farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed\nchange in agricultural policy that would have the effect of\nexposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations\nin income subsidies.\n    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and\na cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive\nat least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how\nmuch they planted.\n    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price\nstabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency\npayments, equal to the difference between a set target price\nand the higher of the support price or market price.\n    The so-called decoupling plan, or \"0/92\", would aim to\ncurtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that\nfarmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.\n    Critics of \"0/92\" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded\nin curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and\ndeficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to\nplant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the\nforefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage\nplantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment\nwith a fixed and gradually declining payment.\n    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of\noffering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.\n    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by\nthe notion of having the federal government subsidize the\npurchase of \"call\" options to help farmers hedge their income\nrisk.\n    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right\nto buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price\nrose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the\noption and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up\nmost of the reduction in the deficiency payment.\n    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer\nlegislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might\nhave to await the results of a pilot project on futures and\noptions trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.\n    The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at\nleast 40 counties which produce major program crops.\n    The program, only recently launched, was designed to\nencourage producers to participate in futures and options\nmarkets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not\nfall below the county loan level for the crops in question.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS",
  "body": "Brazil's recent announcement of a\nsuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign\ndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views\namong many international economists and commodities analysts\nthat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.\n    The developing world's most indebted nation is also its\nmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as\ncoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange\nrevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.\n    \"That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no\nway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\nEconometrics, said.\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\n    \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\nrates,\" Roldan said.\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\nbillion dlrs.\n    But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\"\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\ncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\neach other of intransigence.\n    \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\nwhich others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\nwould suffer.\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\ndealer said.\n    \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"\nhe said.\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\nSecurities Inc.\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\nBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\nthey can't afford to store the crops,\" he said.\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\nconditions towards record yields.\n    \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\nAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can't afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
