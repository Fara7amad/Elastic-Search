  "body": "OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels\nper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the\nprevious month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter\n1986, the International Energy Agency said.\n    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production\nquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings\nwere reduced from several countries, it said in its latest\nmonthly oil market report.\n    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to\nfixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for\nfixed volumes over an extended period.\n    It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\n1987\n    SAUDI ARABIA    4.9              3.7           3.8\n    IRAN            1.6              2.2           1.9\n    IRAQ            1.6              1.6           1.7\n    UAE             1.3              1.2           1.2\n    KUWAIT          1.0              1.0           1.0\n    NEUTRAL ZONE    0.5              0.4           0.4\n    QATAR           0.3              0.3           0.2\n    NIGERIA         1.3              1.2           1.2\n    LIBYA           1.0              1.0           1.0\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\n1987\n    ALGERIA         0.6              0.6           0.6\n    GABON           0.1              0.2           0.2\n    VENEZUELA       1.6              1.6           1.6\n    ECUADOR         0.2              0.2           0.2\n    INDONESIA       1.3              1.2           1.2\n    TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1\n    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota\nof 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to\nNorbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been\nsigned, but it is understood they have much leeway in required\nliftings.\n    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on\nIranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2\nmln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices\napparently cut February production.\n    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the\nTurkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and\n0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal\nconsumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.\n    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in\nFebruary at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and\n47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.\n    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd\nOPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids\n(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other\ndeveloping countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd\nwith centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of\nnon-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)\nand 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.\n    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record\n1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected\nin February in accordance with government curtailments of\napproximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY",
  "body": "U.S. money supply growth is slowing\ndown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the\nFederal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have\ncontracted in February.\n    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the\nFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid\ngrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the\nweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy\nwas justified on account of weakness in the economy.    \n    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported\ntoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary\nforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.\nThe monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.\n    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.\nWith other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit\naccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is\nset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.\n    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional\nlink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of\nfalling interest rates and banking deregulation.\n    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is\nlikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch\nEconomics Inc.\n    \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all\nsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows\nat the Fed,\" McCarthy said.\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"    \n    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\nslowdown in the business expansion.\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\nprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\nthey were a month ago,\" he noted.\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You'd\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"\n    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\nway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line\nwith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc\nargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to\nsolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade\ndeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar\ndepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to\nclose the trade gap, Brusca said \"I'm not prepared to be all\nthat optimistic about the bond market.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro\nlast night concluded this week's tour of European capitals\nhaving gleaned little in the way of concrete support from\ngovernments for his country's attempts to find a radical\nsolution to its debt payments crisis.\n    However, banking sources noted the existence of\nconsiderable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its\ncommercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief\nthat adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems\nwhile patience might pave the way for an eventual\nreconciliation.\n    Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest\npayments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks,\nfollowed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and\ntrade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions.\n    The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration\nin Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter\nof 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation.\nReserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs.\n    Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week\nvisited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government\nofficials and agencies.\n    This week they have sought official support in the U.K.,\nFrance, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\n    They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on\nSunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a\npossible visit to Canada before they return home.\n    Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to\ngovernment representatives, believing that problems with\nBrazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution.\n    However, banking sources noted that their attempts to\nenlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been\nmet almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks.\n    This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for\nBrazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme,\nwith U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also\nrecommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY",
  "body": "Momentum in th U.S. economy may be\npicking up given solid across-the board increases in the\nFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said.\n    U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,\ntwice what the financial markets expected. This follows a\n319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously\nreported 448,000 increase.\n    \"Even if you look at January and February together, this is\nstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in\nthe market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.\n    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much\nlarger gains in February U.S. production and income than\npreviously forecast.\n    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from\n34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\n    \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\npct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\n    \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\nwe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\nthe wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\nhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\nand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\n    \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\neasing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \n  \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he\nsaid. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\nbut it's most likely they'll sit and wait.\"\n    \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\n    \"Things just aren't adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman\nGoverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending,\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\nquarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.\n    \"The employment and production data point to a big\ninventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\nindustries returning to work.\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\nin the first quarter.\n    \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\nthat trade is improving,\" Benderley said.\n    \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\npart of February's employment gain. Retail services employment\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\n    \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\"\nCarson said. \"This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,\nbut there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.\"\n      \n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES",
  "body": "This week's Bank of England resistance to\nstrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in\nholding bank base rates at 11 pct.\n    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris\nGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling\nbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources\nsaid.\n    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing\ntrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the\nParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.\n    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.\n    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted\na substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action\nover the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking\ndistance of that range,\" he said.\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\nbroad target range around this area.\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\n    \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\nare, what's to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\nforeign exchange market.\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\nholds around these levels.\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\nrate boat. \"If rates don't come down, the market will say they\nought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\nnotice.\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\n    \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\nhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\nsterling, at least in the near term.\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\nBudget, said Temperton.\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\n    \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\ncut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\nway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in\nthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last\nFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.\n    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11\n3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest\nsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.\n    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months\nmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cut\nas a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

These would ultimately pay up, he said.\n    He added that losses incurred through loans to tin\nproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had\nbeen written off.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But\nlike last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P\nsaid.\n    The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to\noutpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's\nrating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio\nof downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.\n    S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry\nwould remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers.

  "title": "CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL",
  "body": "U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 \ndlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price\ncould rise another dollar as inventories fall.\n    \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market\nthere is tight supply of crude with short transportation time\nto major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst\nwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices\n50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added.\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to\n18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.\n    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in\nFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a\nbarrel.\n    \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that\noil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its\n15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come\nunder question,\" McKinley said.\n    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly\nreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in\nindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during\nthe first quarter of this year.\n    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first\nquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose\ninventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln\ntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.\n    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd\ndraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday\nfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.\n    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a\nso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying\nofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization\nto offer discounts to the official price.\n    \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the\nultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively\nsoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\"\nthe general trading manager of an international oil company\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\n    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting\nexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own\noutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\nbe 14.7 mln bpd this week.\n    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\noil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\n    \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\nbpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\nthe larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\nit to be there,\" McKinley said.\n    International oil traders said that other short-haul\ncrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\nrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\navailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.\n    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\nthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\nmanagers at several companies told Reuters.\n    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\nOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\n    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\nManagement, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the\nSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\ngives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\"\n     He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\nmembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\nSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\nas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added.\n    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\nspot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\n    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\ninto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\ntraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\n18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\n    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\nEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\n    \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\ndeals, which are below official prices and this is probably\nbeing resold,\" one international trader said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The price increase\nis necessary, he said, to attract more investment.\n    Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recent\nyears to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, adding\nthat he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range this\nyear.\n    \"The consensus on the Street is changing,\" he said, \"from\nwhether there will be increases to when is the next increase\nand how much.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It has\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\nDecember, 1985.\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\nbeverages.\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\nfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated\nby the symbol \"HF,\" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months\ntraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of\nMarch, May, July, September and December.\n    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a\nminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation\nof one dlr per CWT.\n    \"We hope the producers and users of fructose will be\nactively involved, those producers being the large processors,\nthe corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage\nbottlers,\" Henderson said. \"But there are potentials for all\ntypes of people to use it.

  "body": "American Telephone and Telegraph Co's\nproposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is\nunlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it\nshould help the company's profits, analysts said.\n    \"Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large\nvolume users, but status quo for residential users,\" said\nPaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.\n    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has\nconstrained the company's profits in the long distance\nbusiness, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.\n    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance\nbusiness, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated\nrate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut\nlast year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.\n    Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal\nCommunications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount\nof time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to\nits competitors to oppose it filings.\n    MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filing\nyesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition\nin the telephone business.\n    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in\nthe long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins\npreviously constrained by the rate of return. But many said\nthey did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in\nthe industry, simply because of the competition the phone\nindustry giant faces.\n    \"You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,\"\nsaid Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. \"But you wouldn't\nsee a rise.\" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to\nselectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. \"It\nwill give ATT a lot more flexibility,\" he said.\n    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of\ncompanies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC\nhearings.\n    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the\nlong distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and United\nTelecommunications Inc <UT>.\n    \"We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a\nreasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,\" a U.S.\nSprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed\nto greater competition.\n    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,\nand in the process they may be altered by the various\nconstituencies affected by the move.\n    \"There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much\nbureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it\nwon't happen that fast,\" said analyst Victor Krueger of the\nGartner Group.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "CANADA'S MOVE TO SHORTEN DEBT TERMS AIDS MARKET",
  "body": "The government's move to pare its huge\nfinancing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more\nroom for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for\ntreasury bills, senior market analysts said.\n    The Bank of Canada, Ottawa's fiscal agent in the\nmarketplace, revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing\nneeds has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and\nheavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction, issued in\nterms of up to one year.\n    \"The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant\nthat the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances\nand lower financing costs,\" the Bank of Canada said in its 1986\nannual report released this week.\n    The government has said its budget deficit financing\nrequirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year\nending March 31, 1987, from 30 billion dlrs the prior year.\nProjected fiscal 1988 requirements are 21.3 billion dlrs.\n    The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond\nissues, nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10\nyears. Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new\nissues with terms in the two- to five-year range.\n    Meanwhile, treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled\nnearly 70 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over\nthe year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.\n    Although the amount of money saved from moving away from\nthe long bonds was not disclosed, bond experts believe it was\nconsiderable because of the much lower interest premiums paid\non short term debt.\n    But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will\nhave on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian\nbonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference\nfor long term financings.\n    Bond traders said the Japanese, who purchased a record 9.5\nbillion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to the\nchanges by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to\nthe medium term issues offered by Ottawa.\n    \"Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six\nmonths has been very much concentrated in the medium term\nmaturities,\" noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be\nidentified.\n    Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually\ndevelop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years.\n    Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson\nBongard Inc, \"When interest rates finally seem to have stopped\ngoing down, there is going to be a flood of people trying to\nlock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in\nthe door.\"\n    But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates\ntrending down, investors appear to welcome the change,\nespecially the greater treasury bill financing.\n    \"The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,\"\nsaid Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm,\nWalwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd.\n    The change also improves receptivity in the market for\nother borrowers, including provincial governments, the big\nutilities and corporations.\n    \"There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end\nnow, that also may be the result that any percieved shortage\nhas probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,\"\ncommented Berry.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Strikes by Brazil's 40,000\nseamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing\nmajor headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt\ncrisis.\n    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25\nyears and union leaders say they have seriously affected\nBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.\n    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest\npayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp\ndeterioration in its trade balance.\n    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most\npetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial\nheartland, and in three other states closed down to press for\nhigher fuel prices.\n    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages\ncould lead to a serious fuel shortage.\n    The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the\n72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.\n    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today\nentitled \"Dangerous Confrontation,\" said: \"From the economic\npoint of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,\nwith grave consequences for the supply situation and for the\ncountry's external trade.\"\n    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected\noffers of up to 100 pct.\n    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due\nto rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior\nofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao\nFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless\nof the tribunal's ruling.\n    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse\nover the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price\nfreeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not\nonly workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station\nowners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao\nPaulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of\nCuritiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for\nexceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.\n    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their\nprofits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six\nU.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).\n    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last\nnight as motorists filled up their tanks while they still\ncould.\n    Political sources said the government of President Jose\nSarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel\nsupply situation.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure\nfrom one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of\nCommerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,\nenergy industry analysts said.\n    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for\npart of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947\nmln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to\npay down debt, analysts said.\n    \"The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the\ndirection that might make it a saleable asset,\" said one analyst\nwho asked not to be named.\n    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor\nEnergy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in\nCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale \"at\nthe right price.\"\n    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10\nbillion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that\nit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The\nEncor shares do not pay dividends.\n    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked\nwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.\n    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be\nvalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines\nshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.\n    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also\nprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the\nCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.\n    \"Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in\nrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices,\" Peters and Co Ltd\noil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.\n    \"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it\nsold at these levels because they can get more for it now than\nthey have been able to in recent years,\" he added.\n    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at\n7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six\ndlrs in early February.\n    The company also recently set up its own operating\nmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,\nMaison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.\n    Dome and Encor \"are actually going to get farther apart. So\n(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said.\n    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest\nEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale\nproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to\nCommerce Bank.\n    \"I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as\nthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.\n    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to\nblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.\n    \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that\nsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not being\nsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert.\n    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint\nliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic\nPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.\n    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the\npossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.\n    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's\ndebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's\nholding.\n    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares\nwould seek some type of relief on the company's debt\nobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.\n    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what\nprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,\nbut said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are very\nattractive.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Glenn English\n(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to\nimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.\n    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987\nwheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that\nscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.\n    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,\nit is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should\nbe treated equally, they said.\n   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then\nsupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not\noffer their proposals next week, sources said.\n   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles\nStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but\nwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.\n    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first\nchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat\nfarmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid\nfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of\ncontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an\neven greater cutback in the bill, they said.\n    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still\nreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\n    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)\nhave both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to\ninclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains.\n    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm\nbill, but to be fair to all crops.\n    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would\nlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are\ngreater than to idle the land, economists said.\n    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is\npremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the\nHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the\nimpacts of such a program.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY",
  "body": "Brazil's economic crisis is forcing a\nwholesale re-examination of the established strategy for\ndealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.\n    While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed\nin his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the\ndebt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68\nbillion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least\nsome bankers that new ideas are needed.\n    \"The time has come to look at the alternatives,\" one\nseasoned debt rescheduler said.\n    Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating\nthe 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in\nprinciple last October was prompting top bankers to examine \nthe way they are managing the debt crisis.\n    Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recently\nof \"debt fatigue\" and the need to breathe new life into debt\nrescheduling procedures.\n    There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are\nsetting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer\nsome LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,\nimprove financial management and get tax breaks.    \n    But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role\nwill be gradual. \"The process is such that you cannot expect\ntangible progress in a short period of time,\" one banker said.\n    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and\nseveral European capitals in the past week when he called on\ngovernment officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a\npolitical dialogue on debt.\n    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for\ninstance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such\nas debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending\nagencies.\n    \"While such approaches may have some political appeal, they\nare impractical and ultimately counterproductive,\" Mulford told\na House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any\nproposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks\nwould be a non-starter in Congress.\n    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote\naccounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps\nand debt securitization and to enable banks to consider\ninterest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.\n    Experts say the government must also make it easier for\nbanks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.\n    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks\nto explore different options. \"The banks should be encouraged\nto look at the so-called menu approach,\" he said.\n    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates\nintact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their\nexposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.\n    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to\nreceive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to\nnew loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans\nthat fund the interest payments on the old debt.\n    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome\nnegotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of \"exit\nbonds\", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors\nin exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks\nwould be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.\n    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the\ncommercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.\n    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was\nchallenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original\narchitect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a\ntime to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.\n    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. \"There\ndoes seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the\nbank advisory committees,\" a U.S. official said.\n    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on\nMonday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and\nthat U.S. banks are over-represented on them.\n    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's\nCreditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the\ncharge. \"Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer\nprepared to bail out the U.S. banks,\" he told reporters in New\nYork this week.\n    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some\nhave started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still\nthe right tool for the job.\n    \"The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity\nof commercial banks alone, at least in some cases,\" one top New\nYork rescheduler said.\n    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger\nrole, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.\n    \"It's the worst form of government there is apart from all\nthe others,\" one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime\nminister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

According to the police report, King, 42,\nwas in Fort Lauderdale visiting his brother when the incident\noccurred.\n    Police said a taxi driver picked King up outside a Fort\nLauderdale night club but stopped the car after a short\ndistance when he became concerned that his passenger would be\nunable to pay the fare.\n  \"Mr. King attacked the driver, punched him and then took the\ncab and drove off,\" Cefkin said.\n  King was arrested by police a few minutes later and was\ncharged with strong-arm robbery, auto theft and possession of a\nsmall quantity of cocaine, police said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The French have long wanted to control the imports of\nU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the\nimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting\nCo by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell\nthe company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the\ninvestors.\n    Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital\nCorp <NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan,\ndeclined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the\nEntertainment Group. \"We are considering selling the group,\"\nNelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood\nfilm studios which might be interested.\n    Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per\nshare offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12\npct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.\n    Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but\ncontinues as vice chairman of the company.\n    Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by\nMarch 12.\n    If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company\nfinanced by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.\nNarragansett is an investment management company specializing\nin leveraged buyout transactions.\n    Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to\nsay investors believe the bidders may raise their price.\n    Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and\nAmerican Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return\ntelephohe calls seeking comment.\n    But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said \"I\ndon't think it's worth 150 dlrs.\" He noted Taft recently agreed\nto sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.\nHe said the entertainment group, which includes the\nHanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a\nglut of animated product.\n    Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its\nmajor stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the\ncompany.\n    MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the\ncompany with a distribution of various pieces to the major\nshareholders among the possibilities.\n    Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin\nInc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the\nbelief the company would be worth more with a change in its\nstrategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent\ntelevision stations because the company paid too much.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES",
  "body": "Higher oil prices and stronger than\nexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.\ninterest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive\nchart outlook, financial analysts said.\n    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment\nduring February was above market expectations for a rise of\n170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond\nfutures that drove the June contract through key technical\nsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.\n    \"I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,\"\nsaid Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level\nin the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month\ntrading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday\nled to bullish forecasts by chartists.\n    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly\ncharts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.\n    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32\nmay signal a bearish double top formation portending steep\nlosses.\n    \"I tend to go along with the double top scenario,\" said\nNorthern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.\n    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact\nthat the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has\noccurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.\n    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner\nremains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find\nsupport between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.\n    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation\nthat the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on\nan improving inflation outlook.\n    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal\nReserve little room to ease monetary policy, \"the inflation\noutlook is improving,\" Leiner said, and that should lead to\nrelatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar\nprices.\n    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices\nremains a concern for the inflation outlook.\n    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were\nmaintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an\nextra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from\nEcuador after an earthquake Thursday.\n    \"The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,\"\nsaid Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.\n    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely\n\"media induced,\" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC\nproduction may be within quotas, \"oil stocks are at\ntremendously high levels.\"\n    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil\nprices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he\nsaid, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS",
  "body": "Senior officials in the West German\ncoalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would\nbe increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made\nby Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's\ninternational monetary conference in Paris.\n    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social\nUnion Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also\nattended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and\nFree Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion\nmark reduction would represent net tax relief.\n    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.\n    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts\nalready planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.\n    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief\nwould be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal\nincrease in income tax.\n    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers\n1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose\nchildren are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the\ntax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by\nincreasing the level of special depreciations for small- and\nmedium-sized companies.\n    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of\na general reform of the tax system which will come into effect\nin 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this\nreform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would\nbe introduced next year, ahead of schedule.\n    The West German government had come under pressure from the\nUnited States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But\nStoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while\nthe economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of\ngrowth was uncertain.\n    The government said in January it was aiming for real\ngrowth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some\neconomists have revised their predictions down to two or below.\n    Stoltenberg said: \"We remain on a course of expansion.\nWhether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,\nor around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to\nthree pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few\ndays ago, remains open at the moment.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "As a British government investigation got\nunder way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free\nEnterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had\nalready been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.\n    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary\ninvestigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry\ncapsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to\nleave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.\n    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks\nthrough the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend\nThoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.\n    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the\nHerald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned\nto pull them out of service at present.\n    \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait\nand see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC\nradio.\n    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged\nhulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts\nhad already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\"\nferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.\n    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime\nConsultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on\nroll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck\nareas divided by bulkheads.\n    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German\nyard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety\nstandards.\n    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would\nhave had problems getting off this type of ship because of its\ndesign.\n    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley\nsaid the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to\na barge.\n    \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out\nof line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is\ncompartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said.\n    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly\nstable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.\n    \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very\nsevere effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil\nshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at\nleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.\n    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after\nrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links\njungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.\nIt would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,\nthe official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.\nEcuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35\ndays and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.\n    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the\n12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the\npipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil\naccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as\n60 pct of government revenues.\n    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping\nabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd\nabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy\nMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of\n173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.\n    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,\ncosting 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian\npipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take\nabout 60 days to build.\n    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,\nhad only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end\nof January, about equal to one month's imports.\n    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion\ndlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's\ntotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in\nLatin America.\n    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would\nloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three\nmonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.\n    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies\nand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in\nrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.\n    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister\nHector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior\nand defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de\nVenezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and\nco-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Any European Community decision to\nliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca\nindustry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the\nThailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).\n    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to\ncut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more\ncompetitive than tapioca in the European market.\n    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more\nthan two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by\nThailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25\nmln tonnes a year until 1990.\n    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff\nloophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct\nimport duty.\n    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,\nsuggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.\n    He said: \"If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are\nclose to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear\ncompletely.\"\n    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it\nhad recently joined other major commodity producers in calling\non the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Increased federal government borrowing\nneeds and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy\nmark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds\nhigher this year, bond market sources say.\n    \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term\nrates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly\non foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities\ninvestment house in Frankfurt said.\n    The sources also said the government had already stepped up\nits borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.\n    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the\nsources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six\npct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.\n    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct\ncoupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.\n    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract\nforeign investors, and the federal government would have to\npush yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.\n    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased\nin size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume\nonly starting last May.\n    One finance ministry economist said \"It isn't more. It's\njust the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added\nconditions in the capital market currently remained fairly\nfavourable for raising new debt.\n    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,\nwith up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.\n    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,\nforeign investors have begun to back away from the market, as\nhopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.\n    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up\nits borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.\n    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in\n1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing\nthrough bonds was 26.6 billion.\n    The sources said this indicated a move by the government\nout of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds\nthrough the more acceptable loan stock form.\n    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large\namount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including\nthe government's tax reduction program, would also reduce\nincome next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the\nportfolio manager said.\n    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax\nrate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for\nthe government to reduce borrowings.\n    The sources said the government would fall far short of\ncovering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the\ntax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to\nfall back on debt markets in one form or the other.\n    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal\ngovernment loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen\nback twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the\nissue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes.\n    A finance ministry economist said the government did not\nexpect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a\nnet 22.3 billion marks this year.\n    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would\nprobably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come\ninto effect.\n    \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would\nmean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said.\n    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with\nthe Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation\nfalling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.\n    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal\ngovernment loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the\ndollar may now rise against the mark.\n    \"The demand wasn't so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in\nLondon said.\n    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark\neven meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds\nrecently, some dealers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Each has rated some 20,000 to\n30,000 U.S. And about 100 Japanese issues.\n    With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through\noverseas financing companies, Chiyoda's rating will stimulate\ntheir interest in using the U.S. Agencies, the analysts said.\n    Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its\nstrong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels of\nunrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio.\n    The U.S. Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory\nenvironment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate.\n    Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings\non the claims-paying ability of <Sumitomo Life Insurance Co>\nand <Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's,\nthe first ratings given to Japanese life insurers.\n    Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off\nshocks from any foreign investment, Standard and Poor's said.\n    A month ago <Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned\nan AAA rating to <Financial Securities Assurance Inc>, a U.S.\nFirm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities.\n     \"NIS has assigned rates on a U.S. Firm for the first time in\nJapan, which was the first step into the U.S. Rating market,\"\nKazuya Kumura, general manager of NIS, said.\n    Kyosuke Yoshida, managing director of Japan Bond Research\nInstitute (JBRI), said, \"Agencies should be more actively used\nto respond better to growing overseas investor interest.\"\n    Takeshi Watanabe, president of Japan Credit Rating Agency\nLtd (JCRA), said, \"(Our) advantages are that we have a deeper\nunderstanding of business practices in Japan, other Asian\nnations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert\nand quick to react to domestic news.\"\n     JBRI, with 12 years' experience, is Japan's largest agency.\nThe other two have been in business for two years.\n    Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by\nJapanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulate\nlocal agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said.\n    The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by\ngradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation.\n    In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an\nA-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun and\neuroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent\nfinancial criteria.\n     But local companies, regardless of the rating obtained for\na planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set by\ncommissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum net\nasset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managers\nsaid.\n    Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting\nbondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments.\n    Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by\nthe very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese\ncredit rating agencies, the managers said.\n     \"The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into\nprerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial\ncriteria,\" JCRA's Watanabe said.\n    The Finance Ministry, commissioned banks and securities\nhouses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for\ncompanies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.\n    \"An internationally comprehensive market system is needed to\nlure more overseas investors into the Japanese market,\" JBRI's\nYoshida said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "U.S. SEEKS MAJOR JAPANESE ECONOMIC CHANGE IN APRIL",
  "body": "The United States has openly attacked\nJapan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and\nwarned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be\nsignificant, senior U.S. Officials said.\n    In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan's\noverall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its\nfiscal position is not as dire as it says.\n    The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.\nPolicy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating\nattempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.\n    The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by the\nconservative Reagan administration, which until recently has\nbeen sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government\nrole in the economy, diplomats said.\n    Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take\naction to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said\nthe April package must be more than routine.\n    Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do\nnot expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of\nlast April's measures.\n    That means accelerated public investment, lower interest\nrates on government housing loans and measures to pass along\nthe benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of which\nwould have a major immediate economic impact.\n    Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to\nstimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the\nFinance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.\nPolicy.\n    But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by\nfanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domestic\naffairs.\n    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at\nthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan\nwould stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism,\nbut to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.\n    The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousness\nwithin the Reagan administration.\n    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen\nWallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarily\nwant an increase in Japan's budget deficit.\n    \"There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its\neconomy,\" he said.\n    The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n    What is new is U.S. Backing for the position.\n    At last week's talks, Japanese officials said, they argued\nTokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost\nthe economy with funds from the giant postal savings system.\n    But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for,\nand receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, a\nsenior U.S. Official said.\n    Other western officials are not so sure. They said it would\ntake time to boost public investment much further, as there are\nnot that many projects in the pipeline.\n    Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic\nconstruction companies, but it would not have much impact on\nimports, they added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Japanese customers have bought nearly six\nmln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company\n(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and\nWestern traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese\ntraders involved in the transactions told Reuters.\n    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese\ncustomers with different formulas. One company has bought\n800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of\n30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.\n    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and\nDubai spot prices less a discount, they said.\n\n    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to\nreverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot\nmarkets, oil traders said.\n    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder\nweather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was\nbelow its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.\n    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish\nsentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market\nare supporting spot price levels, they said.\n\n    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price\nbut through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a\ndiscount, the sources said. \"It's just disguised cheating,\" one\nJapanese trader said.\n    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the\nofficial price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln\nbarrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in\nSingapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have\nbeen sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the\nofficial price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the\nprice related to processing arrangements.\n\n\u0003",

  "title": "NYSE RULE COULD AFFECT TRADING IN LONDON",
  "body": "An existing New York Stock Exchange,\nNYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of its\nmembers in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sources\nat the London Exchange said.\n    This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes ahead\nwith plans to close its trading floor.\n    The London Exchange sources were commenting on press\nreports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from trading\non the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periods\nwhen the NYSE was open.\n    The London exchange is seeking clarification.\n    London Exchange sources said the possibility of\nrestrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule which\nrequires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess a\ntrading floor.\n    Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that it\nplanned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floor\nfor traded options, because almost all business is now being\ndone by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.\n    This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring of\nthe market on October 27. The demise of the traditional Stock\nExchange floor has been widely expected, though no date has\nbeen set as yet.\n    Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule could\nwell be reached, partly because the interests of U.S.\nSecurities dealers are not all identical.\n    Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointing\nout, among other things, that the expansion of global trading\nneeds to be based on reciprocal arrangements.\n    NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the London\nExchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage over\nnon-NYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the London\nExchange, market sources said.\n    REUTER\n\u0003",

The offer and withdrawal rights\nare to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be\nfollowed by a merger at the same price.\n    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to\nbuy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.\nPiedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.\n    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough\nshares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont\non a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of\nTransportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to\nbuy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain\ncontrol of Piedmont.\n    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont\nprovides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's\nprior written consent in any way that would be adverse to\nPiedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of\nshares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.\n    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to\nbe purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number\nneeded to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be\nsatisfied.\n    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of\nshares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.\n    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in\ncash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir\nshares for each remaining Piedmont share.\n    Last week, Carl C.

  "body": "The 24 nations of the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by\nsluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic\ngrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into\ndeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.\n    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD\neconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a\n2.8 pct growth forecast in December.\n    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the\nsmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest\nhit by currency appreciation this year.\n    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth\nrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in\nDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.\n    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account\ndeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in\nlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.\n    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to\nfall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in\n1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.\n    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr\npayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.\n    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50\ndlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18\ndlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes\nincreasingly ragged.\n    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in\nforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its\ntrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last\nyear's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at\n1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate\nis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an\naverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.\n    \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper\nangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball\nrather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said.\n    \"Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the\nFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and\nCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to\nmore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter\nU.S. Fsical policy,\" it said.\n    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the\nwillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government\nassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.\n    \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding\nthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar\nwould collapse.\n    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates\nwould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt\ncrisis, it said.\n    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look\n\"increasingly sick.\"\n    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen\nslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to\n4.2 pct in 1988, it said.\n    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest\nsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature a\nsluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in\nDecember, the EIU said.\n    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West\nGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while\nJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.\nExporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more\ncompetitively-priced dollar.\n    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and\noil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES",
  "body": "Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl\ntold a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut\nleading interest rates again if the United States makes a\nsimilar move, banking sources said.\n    The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium\nin Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press\nrepresentatives were not invited.\n    The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200\nbankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates\nwould give room for a matching measure in Germany.\n    \"It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,\" said\none banker who attended the symposium.\n    A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no\ncomment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.\n    But, according to a second source, who also declined to be\nidentified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a\ndirect pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend\nGerman industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.\n    \"He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the\nBundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,\"\nthe second source said.\n    In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut\nin the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the\nU.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to\ndiscuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such\na move in advance, the sources said.\n    Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by\ncuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early\nas last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,\n\"No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.\"\n    The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations\ntook place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.\n    Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks\nbetween central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying\nthat financial markets had not fully realised the significance\nof the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further\nfalls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.\n    For the first time all participants at the summit agreed\nthat a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all\nworld economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.\n    The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted\ngrowing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around\ncurrent levels by international central bank cooperation.\n    One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact\nthat the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative\nin monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in\nWest Germany's economic growth.\n    Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past\nstressed that the German central bank had no direct\nresponsibility for growth and was solely concerned with\ncombatting inflation.\n    This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter\nmonetary stance from the beginning of December until the\nhalf-point cut in rates in late January.\n    The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current\novershooting of the German monetary target would not directly\nrespark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react\nimmediately whenever such overshooting occurs.\n    Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's\nmain measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at\n7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.\n    Share prices rose in very active trading today, with\ndealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish\noutlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,\nbrought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In 1987, Venezuela will be\nrequired to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billion\noriginally agreed.

  "body": "<MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company\nformed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer\nfor all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.\n    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and\nwithdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.\n    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln\nof Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and\nis Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in\nNevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono\nMountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc <CJN>,\nwhich owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.\n    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World\nearned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from\nearnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a\nyear before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0\nmln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.\n    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least\nenough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully\ndiluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy\nall Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and\napproval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the\nNEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.\n    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM> has committed to\nlend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best\nefforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing\nfor the transaction.\n    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>,\nhas stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is\nhighly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475\nmln dlrs in \"mezzanine\" financing.\n    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New\nJersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,\nsince ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.\n    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World\nboard, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September\n1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of <Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital\nCorp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise\nhis interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.\n    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and\nchief executive officer Henry Gluck, that \"The decision to go\ndirectly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may\nfinancial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the\nlack of responsiveness of the management in the past.\"\n    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express\nhis views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder\nvalues, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board\nseat.  \"My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,\nyou would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer\nrather than giving it serious consideration,\" he said.\n    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be\nwilling to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.\n    \"As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe\noperating management of the company has performed well and that\nappropriate consideration should be given to a significant\nequity interest for them in the company following the\nacquisition,\" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.\n    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as\nthe record date for the determination of shareholders entitled\nto authorize action without a meeting -- including the election\nor removal of directors.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Dutch economic growth is slowing as a\nfirming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries\nreduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning\nagency CPB said.\n    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic\noutlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to\ngrow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in\n1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.\n    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20\nbillion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase\nfrom last year's 423.95 billion.\n    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of\nthe guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct\nlast year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average\nof 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.\n    \"The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit\nlabour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while\nthese are rising slightly in the Netherlands,\" the CPB said.\n    More of economic growth now depended on domestic\nconsumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set\nby domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on\npurchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.\n    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the\nCPB said. Inflation was zero last year.\n    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five\npct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last\nyear, the CPB said.\n    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to\ncondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent\nyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of\nthese factors on Dutch competitiveness.\n    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social\nsecurity costs to employers.\n    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2\npct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,\nurged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down\nthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in\nfuture.\n    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by\nfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.\n    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this\nyear from 710,000 last year.\n    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is\nwithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two\npct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.\n    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in\nits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant\nprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts\nhad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own\nlatest estimate.\n    \"It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole\ndocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some\nof our estimates,\" a Pierson economist said.\n    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in\n1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy\nexports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.\n    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with\nfour pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.\n    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the\nsurplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1\nbillion last year, the CPB forecast.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING",
  "body": "Ground-breaking new systems for storing\nand retrieving information are ushering in a new era for\ncomputer companies and computer users.\n    Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines\nCorp <IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and others have launched\nproducts that radically increase the amount of data that can be\ncatalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.\n    \"This flurry of new technology could yield systems that\nhandle a multimedia blitz of data,\" said Ian Warhaftig, a\nsenior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.\n    \"We're developing new systems because our customers are\nasking for them,\" Peter Giles, vice president and general\nmanager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recent\ninterview.\n    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While\nestimates vary, industry analysts project that providing\nproducts and services geared for information storage and\nretrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by\n1995.\n    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the\nvarying requirements of users.\n    For example, a large credit verification service would want\na system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and\nrelay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a\ncomputerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,\nis the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability\nto store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be\ncrucial.\n    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward\nconverting information - documents, video or film or even sound\nrecordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones\nunderstood by computers.\n    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for\nstorage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk\ncan store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of\ntypewritten text.\n    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or\nCD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,\nMicrosoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program\nthat contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,\nthesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar\nQuotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.\n    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most\nare specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's <LOTS>\nCD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts\nand investors. \"Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it\nmarks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,\"\nsaid Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.\n    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record\nand read data, is that that it requires a special player.\nCD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this\nyear.\n    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated\nwith personal computers.\n    \"Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box,\" he\nsaid. \"Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and\nthesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word\nprocessing program.\"\n    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak\nunveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The\nlargest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to\n150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter\nof seconds.\n    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8\ngigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The\nKodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of\n1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large\namounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.\n    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips <PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics\ngiant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step\nfurther with the first disk that can combine text, video and\nsound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,\nwill be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM\nplayer that can hook up with a television set and stereo.\n     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next\ngeneration of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month\nIBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing\nmore data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, <Nippon Telegraph and\nTelephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.\n    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several\nyears away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume\nproduction of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.\n    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers\nwith immense memory capacities.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The American Paper Institute said the\nindustry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,\nwith linerboard particularly strong.\n    \"A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currency\nmanagement, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax\nincreases are the essential ingredients in this outlook,\" Red\nCavaney, American Paper Institute president said.\n    Cavaney said that so far this year the industry's\nperformance mimics last year's strength.\n    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a\nrecord 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, while\nindustry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.\n    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in\nthis year's performance.\n    \"Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive\nfactor in the industry's outlook this year,\" he said, citing\nmarket pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at\nthe low end of the industry's long term average.\n    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in\n1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as\na whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.\n    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be\nstrong, spurred by consumer spending.\n    The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax income\nand consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increase\ndemand for both communications paper and packaging this year.\n    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support\nhigh levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for\nmany kinds of packaged goods.\n    Inventory building should help demand for cartons and\ncorrugated containers this year, he added.\n    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in\n1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar\nagainst major world currencies.\n    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade\nin 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial\nactivity at home and thus higher packaging demand.\n    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower\ncosts, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also\ncontribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.\n    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986\ncould have a negative impact on the industry this year.\n    \"For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax\ncredit creates an impediment to future investment,\" he said.\n    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three\nbillion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result\nof reforms.\n    \"Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful\nevaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending\ndecisions of individual companies,\" Cavaney said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "West Germany takes \"very seriously\" the\nrecent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote\nexchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry\nState Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.\n    Talking to journalists before a meeting of European\nCommunity Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer\ndeclined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the\nGroup of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements\nfor stabilising currencies.\n    But he noted the official communique said the participants\nagreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange\nrates around current levels. \"We're taking this sentence very\nseriously,\" he said.\n    Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against\nthe mark since the meeting.\n    He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been\ncaused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris\nagreement should help in this respect.\n    Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the\nBonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the\neconomy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and\nhad not ruled out \"appropriate and timely\" action if necessary.\n    Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion\nby the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the\neconomic situation in the 12-nation bloc.\n    The Commission has sharply revised down expected German\ngross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct\npredicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC\ncountry to stimulate economic activity.\n    Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed\nin the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of\n1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in\nview that would make quick remedial action necessary.\n    He said a number of favourable indicators such as high\nlevel of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a\nrecovery could be expected, while exports would pick up\nslightly during the course of the year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL",
  "body": "The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil\nshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at\nleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.\n    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after\nrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links\njungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.\nIt would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,\nthe official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.\nEcuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35\ndays and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.\n    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the\n12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the\npipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil\naccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as\n60 pct of government revenues.\n    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping\nabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd\nabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy\nMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of\n173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.\n    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,\ncosting 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian\npipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take\nabout 60 days to build.\n    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,\nhad only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end\nof January, about equal to one month's imports.\n    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion\ndlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's\ntotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in\nLatin America.\n    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would\nloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three\nmonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.\n    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies\nand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in\nrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.\n    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister\nHector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior\nand defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de\nVenezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and\nco-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Approval\nwould also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC\nboards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government\nauthorities.\n    If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC\nshareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares\nfor each of their shares valued at four dlrs.\n    AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will\nhave the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on\nthe same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging\nthem for AMC shares.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "SOUTHERN <SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST",
  "body": "Southern Co said it will take an\nafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than\nJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear\npower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers\nin Georgia will be asked to pay.\n    The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said\nthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln\ndlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made\nlast year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased\ncost will not be included in the utility's retail electric\nrates.\n    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled\ncompletion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September\n1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.\n    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit\nOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-power\ntests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a\nfull-power license.\n    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is\nco-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric\nAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.\n    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was\ndue to several factors, including additional labor costs\nincurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for\ncommercial operation by June. The new figure represents the\nfirst change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it\nwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.\n    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would\n\"cap\" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay\nat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected\n8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power\nsaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.\n    Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is\n313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge\nagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.\n    In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts\nwith the joint owners require the utility to buy back\nsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's\ninitial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it\nwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase\nthat applies to the buybacks.\n    This bings the total amount that must be charged against\nearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.\n    Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require\nany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged\nagainst earnings once that determination is made.\n    The company also said its board has approved a capital\nbudget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the\nVogtle project.\n    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year\nperiod 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting\nthis is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years\n1986-1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The 24 nations of the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by\nsluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic\ngrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into\ndeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.\n    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD\neconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a\n2.8 pct growth forecast in December.\n    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the\nsmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest\nhit by currency appreciation this year.\n    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth\nrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in\nDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.\n    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account\ndeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in\nlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.\n    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to\nfall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in\n1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.\n    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr\npayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.\n    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50\ndlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18\ndlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes\nincreasingly ragged.\n    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in\nforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its\ntrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last\nyear's 18.4 pct drop.\n    The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year\nand 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break\nthrough the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in\n1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.\n    \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle\nof descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather\nthan a three-point landing,\" the EIU said.\n    \"Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the\nFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and\nCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to\nmore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter\nU.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said.\n    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the\nwillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government\nassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.\n    \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that\nif Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would\ncollapse.\n    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates\nwould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt\ncrisis, it said.\n    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly\nsick.\"\n    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen\nslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to\n4.2 pct in 1988, it said.\n    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest\nsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature a\nsluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in\nDecember, the EIU said.\n    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West\nGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while\nJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.\nExporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more\ncompetitively-priced dollar.\n    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and\noil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.\n    However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over\nthe current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices\nwill show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first\ntime since 1984, the EIU said.\n    After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of\ninternationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in\n1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.\n    It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6\npct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "A free trade pact between the United\nStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sides\nsubstantially, according to a study released by the Institute\nfor International Economics.\n    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion\nto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's\ngross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.\nexport's by about seven pct.\n    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of\ngovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and\ninvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n    The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest\ntrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150\nbillion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They\nare aiming for a pact by next October.\n    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of\nMaryland, said an agreement should include:\n    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased\nin over a five to 10-year period;\n    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two\ncountries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\"\nprovisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision;\n    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance\nand transportation;\n    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor\ndomestic producers;\n    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.\n     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the\ntwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to\n2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.\n    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.\n    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset\nsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission for\nresolution at an early stage.\n    Wonnacott said \"bilateral free trade would contribute to the\nefficiency of the North American economies and to their\ncompetitiveness in facing overseas producers.\n    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian\ngoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass\nproduction.\n    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to\nCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already large\nU.S. gross national product.\n    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas\nas export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission\ncould set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write\nnew and more liberal global trading regulations.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct\nand will be available for dealings from March 11, with the\nremainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the\nbonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free\nof tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated\n8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was\nreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.\n    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's\nannouncement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08\nquoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20\nminutes after the news.\n    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the\nbackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates\nwhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result of\nsterling's strength.\n    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to\nsee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon\nannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11\npct.\n    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate\ncut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay\na reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March\n17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.\n    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable\nclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and\nallow a half-point cut.\n    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market\nas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early\nrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.\n    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now\nfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time\nof the budget, although one or two said they would not be\nsurprised to see a full point decline at this stage.\n    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts\nlast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued\na one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the\nGovernment bond market.\n    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold\nout within hours of becoming available for trading and the\nmarket pushed on to register further sharp gains.\n    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the\nissue announced today would be absorbed by the market as\nrapidly as last week's.\n    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down\nfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed\non a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final\n71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300\nGMT.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "President Reagan's denial that he\nknew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan\ncontra rebels might be challenged by his former national\nsecurity adviser, according to the Washington Post.\n    The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resigned\nlast November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrs\nwas disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so far\nmaintained over the affair.\n    The Post said he might tell a special Senate committee\ninvestigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in\n1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to the\ncontras.\n    It said the panel was considering granting Poindexter\nimmunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which was\nillegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time against\naid for the contras.\n    Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution which protects people from giving evidence which\ncould be self-incriminating.\n    Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran in\nthe hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but has\ndenied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebel\nhands.\n    A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story,\nbut David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling of\nthe affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action.\n    Abshire, on the CBS television show \"Face the Nation,\" did\nnot comment directly on the Post story, but said: \"He (Reagan)\nis deeply honest, he is deeply dedicated, he tells the truth\nand when he says he has no knowledge, he has no knowledge.\"\n    The Post quoted a source close to Reagan as saying the\nWhite House expected Poindexter \"will say he had direction and\nauthority, directly or indirectly,\" from the president for the\ndiversion of funds.\n    The paper said the former security adviser's testimony\ncould damage the president's claim he was unaware of the funds\ndiversion.\n    It quoted a legal source as saying Poindexter and his\nlawyers planned to contend that twice in 1986 he told Reagan\nthat the arms sales were generating money for the \"contras.\"\n    The paper quoted the source as saying Poindexter did not\ntell Reagan there was an illegal diversion of funds, but that\nhelp for the contras was \"an ancillary benefit\" of the sales.\n    The Post's sources also said the Senate committee could\ngrant immunity from prosecution this month to Oliver North, who\nwas fired from the National Security Council on the same day\nthat Poindexter resigned.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "A half point cut in base lending rates\nwas announced by the big four clearing banks today after the\nBank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of\ndownward pressure, dealers said.\n    During its routine intervention in the market, the bank\ntrimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by\nhalf a point and National Westminster led the other clearing\nbanks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.\n    The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by\nsurprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen\nhopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.\n       For some time, fundamentals have\nled the market to push for a one point cut in base lending\nrates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow\nwholesale money market rates down.\n    Although political considerations -- the government's wish\nto see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had\nbeen suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's\ndelaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling\nand perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the\nBudget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers\nsaid.\n    In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,\nleaving the market still looking for another half point fall.\n    Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the\nday, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to\n10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at\n10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between\n5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.\n    Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at\naround 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the\nend of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some\n11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated\n300 mln stg shortage.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT",
  "body": "In an unusual move, Standard and Poor's\nCorp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it was\npriced for offering late last week.\n    But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, which\ninvestment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency's\nrate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.\n    S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B from\nB-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of Holiday\nInns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp <HIA>. The notes were priced\nlate Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflected\na change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debt\nfrom secured. That change was made after the agency rated the\nnotes on February 20, S and P stated.\n    \"We took action as we became aware that the issue's\nstructure had changed,\" said Robert Nelson of S and P. \"We\ngenerally make a distinction between secured and unsecured\ndebt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade.\"\n    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the\nHoliday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by\nlate Friday afternoon.\n    \"The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issued\nbasis,\" the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P's\nannouncement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.\n    That is a far cry from late September, when S and P\ndowngraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund\ndebentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd <NWP> just hours\nafter the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus from\nB-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.\n    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially\ngave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It\nthen repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.\n    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs\nfrom an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in\nS and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action\nand said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operations\nwould not be enough to adequately service debt.\n    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency\nwas not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in\nsize. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating\nagencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.\n    In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined to\nfollow suit, bond traders noted.\n    Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original rating\nof B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.\n    Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes would\nbe unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would\nbenefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for\nspecified collateral under certain circumstances.\n    The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognize\na highly leveraged debt structure that would result from\nHoliday's recapitalization program, as well as the company's\ndependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for\nnear-term debt service.\n    \"Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot\nremember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after\nthe pricing,\" remarked one corporate bond trader.\n    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of\nsubordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par\npricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minus\nby S and P were left unchanged on Friday.\n    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the\nsecond-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,\nunderwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI\nHoldings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.\n    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the\nappetite of many investors for high-yield securities.\n    \"People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about\ndownside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by\nwell-known companies,\" said one portfolio manager.\n    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week's\nplanned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of\nsenior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior\nsubordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.\n    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it has\ntentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "GERMAN BANKS SAY COMPANY HOLDINGS FALLING",
  "body": "West German private banks, in the\nlatest twist in a long-running battle over the size of their\nholdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling and\nrejected calls for tighter limits on these participations.\n    Under West Germany's banking system, banks can hold shares\nin non-banking companies giving them seats on company\nsupervisory boards, and administer the holdings of small\nshareholders in safe custody accounts.\n    Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in the\nsupervisory board of a company, must be disclosed.\n    \"The claim that the concentration of power has intensified,\nas made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out not\nto be accurate ... There is no reason to impose further legal\nrestrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks,\" it said.\n    The Association's letter is the latest skirmish in a long\nrunning battle between banks on the one hand and a range of\ngovernment offices and political lobbies on the left and right.\n    The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companies\nwith a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held by\nthese 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said.\n    Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25\npct in 1976. The banks' holdings of nominal share capital fell\nto 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted for\ncapital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976.\n    Over this period total West German nominal share capital\nrose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holding\nof banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct.\n    The nominal share capital of listed non-bank companies rose\nto an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in\n1976, with banks' holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2\npct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said.\n    It argued that bank representatives were in a minority on\nthe supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, and\nin most cases could be blocked by non-banking representatives.\n    The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>, Dresdner Bank\nAG <DRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG\n<BVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG\n<BHWG.F>.\n    It also covered Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank\n<BHFG.F>, <Berliner Bank AG>, <Industriekreditbank AG>,\nVereins- und Westbank AG <VHBG.F> and <Baden-Wuerttembergische\nBank AG>.\n    Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes,\nincluding 28.5 pct of Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F>.\n    Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from the\nMonopolies Commission and left-wing parties. An advisory\ncommission, in a report late last year to the Economics\nMinistry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by the\nMonopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interest\nconflicts.\n    The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberal\nFree Democrat Party, junior partner in the centre-right\ncoalition government and increasingly in favour of\nderegulation.\n    Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recently\nsupported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demanding\nmore transparency in the bank's balance sheet.\n    The shareholder argued that the bank's ability to declare\nindustrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporary\nholdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them in\nfull. If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have to\ndisclose them but can include them under securities holdings.\n    The case is due to be heard again by the Frankfurt higher\nregional court.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Until the World Bank was confident that\nthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.\n    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over\nthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,\nfor some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new\ninstruments such as bonds with warrants.\n    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany\nsince the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.\n\n\u0003",

As a\nresult, it said that \"inflation and ultimately another\nrecession now loom on the horizon.\"\n    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on\nprogressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead\nto sustainable economic growth and stable prices.\n    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or\ninflation growth in its policy statement. However, the\nCommittee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was\nbasically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a\nmember of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.\n    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage\npoint higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer\nprices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.\n    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been\na principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly\ninflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to \"abandon\nits inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary\nbase on the path toward sustained lower inflation.\"\n    The Fed in February said it would no longer target the\nnarrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and\neconomic growth has been largely severed.\n\n\u0003",

  "body": "USX Corp chairman David Roderick called\nfor a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies\nto help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which\nlast year reached 170 billion dlrs.\n    In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club\nof Detroit, Roderick said, \"There should be total resolve that\nthe dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the\ncurrencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus\nwith us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our\ntrade deficit starts on the road to recovery.\"\n    Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the\n\"economic pain\" our trading partners experience as a result of\na falling dollar.\n    But, he added, \"As painful as the correction may be to our\ntrading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem\nuncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,\nlengthy and steep world recession.\"\n    Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the\ndollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major\nindustrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader\ngroup of currencies of nearly all developing nations.\n    At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in\nthe U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240\nbillion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a\nsurplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the\ndata were provided by economic consultants to USX.\n    The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct\nrise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other\nfactors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,\n\"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental\ndeterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product\nquality.\"\n    These areas need to be improved but they are not the root\ncause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged\nAmerican manufacturers to become more competitive so they can\ncompete in global markets.\n    In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in\nsecurities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate\nraiders and speculators.\n    Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate\nBanking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement\nthat raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock\nthey acquire in a company.\n    Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all\ncash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be\nrequired to have financing in place before a tender is made.\n    Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash\ntender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's\nstock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential\nprice by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should\nbe prohibited under the revised laws.\n    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but\nthat he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets\nor discourage \"fair price to all\" takeovers.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans\nto launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnell\nDouglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.\n    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, a\nsuccessor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders and\noptions.\n    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now\nseeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companion\nplane, the shorter-range A330.\n    \"I don't want to say we're not interested, because we are\nin any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without it\ngiving up anything,\" the source told Reuters. \"There just\nhaven't been in-depth discussions.\"\n    He said any joint venture would not affect the MD-11\nprogram already underway.\n    McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried to\noverturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offering\ncut-rate prices for the A340.\n    The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enough\ncustomers to launch the program, is engaging in \"predatory\npractices\" with prices substantially below those needed to\nrecover the cost of developing and building the plane.\n    U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believe\nAirbus can offer low prices because the consortium gets\ngovernment subsidies that cover many of its costs.\n    The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determine\nwhether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules an\nenterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit.\n    U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billion\ndlrs into Airbus since the early 1970's and the consortium has\nyet to make a profit.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of\nAmerican Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,\nincluding the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in\nAmerican Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.\n    They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782\nmln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.\n    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing\nChrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's\nagreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln\ndlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not\nincluded valuing the transaction.\n    Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed\npurchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the\ntransaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in\nChrysler's earnings.\n    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told\nReuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it\nwould have been had a deal been struck last year because the\nimpact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to\nassume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards\naccumulated from its losses since 1980.\n    \"There were very serious discussions last fall but we\ndidn't pull it off,\" the source said in a reference to the\nassassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges\nBesse.\n    \"It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.\nAnd Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done\nit before the end of last year.\"\n    In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the\nsource said Chrysler would also assume any liability from\nlawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called \"an overhang\nto the company.\"\n    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that\nthe deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal\nin the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln\ndlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25\nmln dlrs in cash for \"transaction fees\" in connection with the\nacquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid\nAMC shareholders.\n    \"The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,\"\nanalyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.\n     Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12\nbillion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.\n     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's\nliabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC\ndebt that is being carried at \"non-market\" rates.\n    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the\nprevious Renault management on the acquisition because they\nwere committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an\nintegral part.\n    \"The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't\ntheir baby,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Philippines' bank advisory\ncommittee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novel\nproposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the\ncountry's interest bill with investment notes instead of cash,\nbankers said.\n    Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12-bank advisory\ncommittee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.\n    Bankers declined to comment on today's meeting but said the\npanel's response could be crucial to the fate of the talks,\nwhich are now in their second week. \"The ball's in our court\nnow,\" one banker on the committee said.\n    Under Ongpin's rescheduling plan, the Philippines would\noffer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate.\n    Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would be\noffered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a margin\nof one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes, PINs,\nbankers explained.\n    These tradable, dollar-denominated zero-coupon notes would\nhave a maturity of six years, but they would be redeemable at\nany time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as part\nof the government's debt-equity scheme.\n    Because banks would be able to sell the PINs to\nmultinational investors at relatively small discounts to face\nvalue, their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8\npct cash margin, according to the Philippine proposal.\n    Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment in\nthe Philippines, the PINs idea is likely to run into stiff\nresistance by at least some members of the bank advisory\ncommittee because it would establish the precedent of some\ninterest payments being made with paper rather than cash.\n    Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants had\ngiven a green light to his idea, but bankers are not so sure.\n    U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to account\nfor the notes in the same way as accruing cash interest\npayments and that their profits would suffer accordingly.\n    If the banks reject the proposal out of hand, however, they\nrun the risk of scuttling the talks, for Ongpin has insisted\nthat he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct.\n    The Phillipines is asking the banks to reschedule 3.6\nbillion dlrs of debt falling due between 1987 and 1992 and to\ngrant easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously\nrestructured debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS",
  "body": "U.S. authorities intervened in the\nforeign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion\nduring the period between the start of November 1986 and the\nend of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a\nreport.\n    The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations\nsaid that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen\non January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese\nmonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the\nU.S. Treasury.\n    The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president\nReagan's State of the Union message and was \"in a manner\nconsistent with the joint statement\" made by U.S. Treasury\nsecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi\nMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations.\n    At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to\ncooperate on exchange rate issues.\n    The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention\noccurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen\nafter dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It\nhad closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day.\n    The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98\nyen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks\non January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks.\n    The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout\nNovember and the first half of December, the dollar moved\nsharply lower until the end of January.\n    It closed the three-month review period down more than 11\npct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and\nseven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen\nfour pct against the Canadian dollar.\n    During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar\nsubsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation\nand talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial\ncountries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on\nexchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said.\n    Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.\ninterest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questions\nabout whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease.\n    Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks\nand 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, it\nhad declined nine pct since the beginning of the period.\n    The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in\nearly November.\n    The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on\nNovember 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth\nof marks and yen.\n    The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza\nagreement between the five major industrial nations under which\nthey agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Arbitration Commission awarded\nthe Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increase\nand allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second-tier\nincrease of up to four pct, Commission President Justice Barry\nMaddern said here.\n    The decision is effective from the next pay period of\nindividual employers, he said in delivering the Commission's\nNational Wage Case decision.\n    Full-time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00\ndlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, according\nto latest official statistics.\n    The wage decision is the first under the previously\nannounced two-tier system which replaced the concept of wage\nindexation. It is the first national wage rise since a\npartially-indexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by the\nCommission last July.\n    The decision is a compromise between the Federal\ngovernment's call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weekly\nrise plus a three pct second-tier ceiling and the Australian\nCouncil of Trade Unions' (ACTU) claim of 20 dlrs and up to four\npct.\n    Employer groups had sought no rise at all.\n    The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case in\nOctober to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pct\nshould be awarded, Maddern said.\n    He said the success of the new system depended on the\ncommitment of all parties - employers, unions and governments.\n    He said the Commission had rejected employers' calls for a\nfreeze on overall labour cost increases.\n    \"We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given the\nneeds and expectations of wage and salary earners,' he said,\nadding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of a\ncooperative effort to lift Australia's economic performance.\n    The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciation\nof the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade would\nnot be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said.\n    If necessary, it would arbitrate second-tier claims at an\nimplementation rate of no more than two pct from September this\nyear and a further two pct from July 1988, he said.\n    He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the life\nof the package, adding that second-tier rises will be mainly\nachieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, covering\nelimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiency\nand productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes.\n    Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for a\ncut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers to\nbe exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe or\nextreme economic adversity.\n    The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in its\nlast decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious.\n    \"The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in the\neconomy which underlines the economic circumstances must be\nallayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around.\nIn this connection, what happens to labour costs is of critical\nimportance,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He said a major government inquiry into\nthe disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from\nBritain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit\nlights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.\n    Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine\nhow the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's\ndoors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.\n    Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun,\none Belgian and one by the ferry's owners.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Japanese microchip makers are being\nstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on\nsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's\nmarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said.\n    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring\nthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether\nthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any\nbreathing space, they said.\n    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September\nhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese\nchipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.\n    \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry\nto get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate\nvice president Peter Wolffe.\n    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the\nJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive\nchips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject\nto the pact's price controls.\n    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide\ndistributors with certificates designating them as authorised\nexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey\nmarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.\n    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in\njeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets\nand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.\n    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the\nproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp\nsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request.\n    \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's\ndemands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"Once\nNEC cuts production, it means they all have.\"\n    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese\nfirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that\nthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.\n    \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said Salomon\nBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.\n    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also\nspur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt\nAizawa said.\n    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new\nrestrictions, some industry officials said.\n    \"It's like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, head\nof MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, another\nopens.\"\n    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier\nshrugged off MITI guidance.\n    \"It's getting to be like communism,\" said one.\n    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it\neasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing\nfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.\n    \"They're going to have to start running their businesses\nlike businesses,\" Bache's Wolffe said.\n    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign\nurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry\nofficials said response has been mixed at best.\n    \"There has been some change, but it's not across the board,\"\nsaid one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree of\nurgency.\"\n    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the\ntroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.\n    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic\nrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transition\nto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.\n    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory\nchips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they\nsaid.\n    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.\nConsortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the\nmost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.\n    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.\nCommitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.\n    \"The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't\neven have an office here,\" a source close to the industry said.\n\"You could question just how committed they are.\"\n    In addition, some industry analysts question the\neffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third\ncountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea.\n    \"(South) Korea's gaining market share,\" said one analyst.\n\"They're the real winners from the agreement.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants\noil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to\navoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.\n    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television\nnews agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make\nto Britain later this month.\n    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared\nto reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln\nbarrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price\nagreed to by OPEC last December.\n    The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by\nitself but certainly desires price stability.\"\n    Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common\ninterest so that there is no type of competition which could\nprove harmful to everyone,\" he said.\n    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first\nstep towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not\nfor Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such\nissues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher\nbenchmark.\n    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,\ndue partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd\nsaid Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was\nadhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which\nset a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.\n    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the\ngroup's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.\n    The King also urged the world community to help the\nPalestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful\nend to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be\nresolved on the battlefield, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The striking price was a partly paid\n41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.\n    Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for the\nbonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulated\nby sterling's surge at the opening this morning.\n    The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seen\nas a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for a\nfurther U.K. Interest rate reduction following the half-point\ncut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier in\nthe day.\n    Dealers said that the Bank's strategy succeeded in stemming\npressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as the\nmarket yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on Monday\nimmediately after the announcement.\n    Demand for the issue was lively from U.K. And overseas\nsources, with particular interest seen from Japan.\n    The bonds were issued at a price of 96-16/32 stg pct,\npartly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although the\nGovernment broker this morning sold them at a premium of one\nstg pct over the partly paid issue price.\n    The issue has been designated the \"B\" tranche of the bonds,\nsince 1.3 billion stg of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997\nis already in issue.\n    Dealers noted that the Bank of England last week issued one\nbillion stg of nine pct Exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effort\nto dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused by\nsterling's uptrend on foreign exchange markets.\n    Last week's issue was sold out on its first day of dealings\nbut with nothing resembling the determined demand seen this\nmorning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said.\n    After stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, the\nauthorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on Monday,\nfollowing it up with the announcement of the one billion stg\nbond issue.\n    Sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but this\nmorning opened very strongly again, starting on a\ntrade-weighted basis at 72.6 against yesterday's final 72.1 and\nlater edging up to 72.7.\n    U.K. Money market rates declined again this morning by up\nto 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterday's speculation that\nclearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figures\nafter the budget next Tuesday, money market dealers said.\n    U.K. Government bond dealers noted that under the influence\nof stronger sterling and the further fall in money market\nrates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 point\nhigher at the longer end of the market.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP",
  "body": "China's foreign debt reached 27 billion\ndlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to\nshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very\ncreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign\nbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.\n    Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from\nan estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased\nimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,\nbetween eight and 10 pct.\n    China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.\n    Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations\nand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan\nagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on\n1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.\n    Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in\nthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said\nthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.\n    A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much\nshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a\nresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive\nlow interest rates in the Japanese market.\n    The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is\nlikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.\n    A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the\ncountry's total debt at about 30 pct.\n    The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house\nsaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.\n    \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,\nwhich will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go\nelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he\nsaid.\n    The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is\nin part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital\nmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.\n    \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department\nor firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the\nfull backing of the People's Republic of China,\" he said.\n    \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other\nareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable\nautonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to\nexercise indirect controls,\" he said.\n    The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the\npast six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be\naffected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase\nmeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of\nCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.\n    A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's\nforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially\nstated figure of 10 billion dlrs.\n    \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the\nmarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in\nadvance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said.\n    The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things\nare normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in\n1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\"\n    Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9\nbillion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.\n    A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official\nsaid this year's outlook for exports, which account for more\nthan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier\nthan a year ago.\n    The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It\nwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.\n    The official said China has taken measures to improve its\nexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters and\nthe establishment of export production bases.\n    \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he\nadded.\n    Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the\ndrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.\n    A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful\nmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at six\nto eight pct.\n    \"We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange\nreserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a\ncompany on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said.\n    He said China performed very well in the export field last\nyear and remains a very creditworthy country which will have\nfew difficulties in increasing its borrowing.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "A tight money market has pushed\ninterest rates on three to six month time deposits to between\n15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.\n    March is usually a tight month for the money market because\nof tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their\nyear-end accounts on March 31.\n    This year the situation has been made worse by December's\nrush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared\nimposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet\nto be converted back into rupiah.\n    \"A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is\nholding out until after April,\" one U.S. Banker said.\n    The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank,\nis helping to keep rates high.\n    Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no\nprospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.\n    Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week\nthat Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects\nin 1987/88, but added the \"speculators\" who led a run on the\nrupiah late last year could again pose problems.\n    Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in\nfive years, and most businessmen expect no new government\neconomic packages or incentives before then.\n    \"Some people are nervous about what the government will do\nafter the election,\" one banker said. \"They normally try to do\nthings before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia)\nmeeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the\neconomy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars.\"\n    The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries\nand four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft\nloans and grants last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will\nstep down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system\ngets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said\ntoday.\n    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private\nmeeting, \"Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily\nterminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when\n(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval.\"\n    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite\nSunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the\nruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative\nstronghold.\n    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,\nhad campaigned against a controversial five pct value added\nsales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.\n    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the\nsales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding\nnothing but retraction of the tax.\n    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the\n1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax\nplans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of\nparliament since February 4.\n   \"If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular\nparliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice\nsummit of industrial democracies in June and open an\nextraordinary session to discuss the tax plans,\" the aide said.\n    Under law, a regular session can be extended only once\nwhile an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other\noption would be to extend the current session, he said.\n    \"The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence\nmotion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another.\"\n    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up\nthe way for tax reform.\n   \"Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet\nen masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House\nfor a snap general election,\" the aide said.\n    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign\nfrom the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.\n    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its\nlandslide victory in general elections last July.\n    There are five independents and three vacancies.\n    \"The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate\ntheir seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism,\" the\naide said.\n    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little\neffect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.\n    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the\nnation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.\n    \"Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all\noppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.\n    \"Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial\nelections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and\nFukuoka in southern Japan,\" he said.\n    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN",
  "body": "A spokesman for Preussag\nAG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company\nwould pay a dividend on 1986 results\n    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said\nresults in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has\nfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986\nfollowing a difficult year in 1985.\n    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in\nDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not\ndipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the\nfinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.\n    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared\nwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and\nshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in\nthe group's other divisions.\n    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic\ngroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend\npartly on the level of provisions.\n    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine\nmarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped\nto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.\n    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks\nin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.\nDomestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.\n    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by\nunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by\npoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.\n    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter\nof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an\nadditional factor behind the drop in results.\n    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced\nwould not begin to take full effect until this year.\n    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion\nmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first\ntime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its\nmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.\n    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone\nwas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison\nfigures.\n    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0\npct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose\nto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.\n    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)\nsubsidiary, whose results are included in the world group\naccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of\nlast year.\n    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the\ninternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the world\ngroup losses that year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

So\nfar this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the\ndollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.\n    He said South Korea was selecting \"many\" of 122 items on\nwhich Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help\nnarrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were\ngiven.\n    Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158\nitems, including sensitive agricultural products and large\ncars, effective from July.\n    South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus\nlast year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1\nbillion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier\nforecast that its current account surplus could reach eight\nbillion dlrs this year.\n    But the government official said the surplus would be held\nat around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by\nindustrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "The Bank of Spain has extended the\nreserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds\nin an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which\nis currently fuelling money supply growth.\n    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank\nsaid convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject\nto exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve\nrequirement with effect from Friday.\n    Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from\nreserve requirements.\n    The measure comes one week after the central bank raised\nreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage\npoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.\n    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer\nnow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a\nlarge influx of speculative foreign capital which is\nthreatening the government's monetary targets.\n    They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain's\nprincipal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid\nassets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17\npct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3\npct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The\ntarget for 1987 is eight pct.\n    The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to\nbanks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money\nmarket. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly\nTreasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserve\nrequirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from\nthe system.\n    The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest\nrates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pct\naverage for deposits.\n    Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable\nresponse \"given that the market is short of funds.\"\n    But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest\nrates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtail\nshort-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish\nmoney markets more attractive.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN",
  "body": "The U.S. is urging reluctant\ncommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel\nPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes\nthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt\nstrategy, a Reagan administration official said.\n    The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas\nfor interest rate concessions should be treated much more\nseriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing\nnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.\n    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to\nreconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would\nbe pooled, and suggested the administration would support such\na plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the\nsame time, however, the official expressed reservations that\nsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground.\n    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine\nsuggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome\nrole of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to\nunderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,\nthe official said in an interview with Reuters.\n    \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our\ninitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and\nunique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the\nofficial, who asked not to be named.\n    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy\nunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such\nas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nwere urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.\n    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact\neconomic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.\n    \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors\nhave been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted\nthat the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an\nexception.\n    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.\nDebt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,\nalso said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve\ntheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.\n    \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications\nto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more\neffectively,\" the official said.\n    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that\ncommercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World\ndebt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional\nAmerican or European institutions.\n    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to\nlend money to their former debtors every time a new money\npackage was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in\nits current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.\n    He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration\nplan but \"something some people have suggested.\"\n    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are\nexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third\nWorld debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would\ndiffer slightly from the one the official described.\n    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan\nwould work in the United States.\n    \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,\nfine. I don't think they ever will.\"\n    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World\nloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant\nto provide new money to debtors through the new institution.\n    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under\nwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no\nmore than 5/8 pct above Libor.\n    \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite\nunique and I don't think it's something that should be\ncategorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said.\n    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be\noffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin\nabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment\nNotes.\n    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a\nsix-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before\nmaturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point\nover Libor.\n    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too\nlow. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at\nstretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and\ngranting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled\ndebt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support\nin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last\nyear, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.\n    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate\ncapitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the\nbanks. \"It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you\nhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed\nbefore,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to\nbe granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue\nthat (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really\nis is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added.\n    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an\ninitiative to include plans like the Philippines'.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "title": "POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION",
  "body": "Interest in the currency futures market\nhas shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially\nexplosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental\nand Japanese currencies, analysts said.\n    The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past\nweek-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the\ndollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.\n    \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and\ntechnically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber\nanalyst Jason Gillard said.\n    \"We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and\nwe're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,\"\nSmith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.\n    Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark\nfutures positions, although some of those cross-trades were\nliquidated yesterday, Sloane said.\n     The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been\nrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism\nsurrounding the British economy, analysts said.\n    \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear\nStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.\n    Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the\npound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to\nrelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down\ninterest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.\n    The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how\nwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates\nand oil income remain the main influences on the currency.\n    However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.\ninterest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut\ntheir discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane\nsaid.\n    The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but\nSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.\n    The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with\nsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on\nprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said.\n    \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often\nleads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said.\n    Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian\ndollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent\nclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.\n    \"At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term\npositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a\nclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said.\n    As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability\nwas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.\n    Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and\nJune German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,\nrespectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.\n    Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very\nrespectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank\nintervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.\n    \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers\nsaid, \"but people are very reluctant because they don't know\nwhere the central banks will be (to intervene).\"\n    Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price\nconsolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly\nsluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at\nthat level.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "European Community\nCommission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong\nobjections from some EC government heads to his radical plan\nfor changes to Community financing.\n    In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC\nleaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow\nadditional resources for the bloc when they were themselves\npruning their own spending.\n    Others called for major spending cut in the EC's\ncontroversial farm policy in order to free money for regional\nand social development.\n    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors\nplan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a\nsecond two-year term.\n    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the\nEC should be based on their gross national product instead of\non the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this\nwould increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of\nsharing the financial burden.\n    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about\nincreased payments, he had told some heads of government the\nCommunity needs more money.\n    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to\nreform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for over\ntwo thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget.\"We have to ask\nfor sacrifices but we have to create a future for those\nfarmers.\"\n    He added, \"I was forced to say to some heads of government -\nDo you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when\nyou are asking for a common market in goods and services?\"\n    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine\ninternal market in industrial products and services.\n    Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing\ngroup resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "Lower production of coconut\nand palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks\nthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds\nanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.\n    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta\nAgriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world\nvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.\n    \"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside\npotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented\ndecline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said.\n    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm\nkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln\ntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.\n    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at\n33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance\nat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.\n    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,\ndisappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by\n600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.\n    \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the\ncrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in\nthe edible oils sector could develop,\" he said.\n    \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high\noil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said.\n    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices\nbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.\n    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase\nfor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,\ncompared with 25.4 mln last year.\n    The increase should result from lower disappearance, as\nproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7\nmln last year, he said.\n    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln\ntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,\nwhile production of other oilseeds was lower.\n    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made\nup for lower production in the United States, he said.\n    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.\nstocks make up most of those, Balletto said.\n    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,\nabout half of the world soybean surplus, he said.\n    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased\n13.1 mln tonnes.\n    \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1\nmln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world\nsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially\nhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\"\n    \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds\nprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long\nas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.\n    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a\nrange tied to the U.S. loan program.\n    \"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply\noverhang while strong underlying support is provided by the\nU.S. loan rate.\"\n    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially\nhigh prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and\nAustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch\ntheir credit lines from one borrower to another.\n    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also\nmeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower\ninterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather\naccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the\ncentral bank.\n    \"It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,\"\none banker said.\n    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of\na 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister\nDilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for\nBrazil's debt stance.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "CHINA WELCOMES U.S. COURT BOND DECISION",
  "body": "China welcomed a U.S. Supreme Court\ndecision dismissing claims by holders of 41 mln dlrs of\npre-1949 Chinese bonds, but U.S. Officials said Peking has a\nlong way to go before it can issue bonds in the U.S.\n     A Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news briefing that\nChina welcomed a Monday court ruling, which rejected a petition\nby holders of railway bonds issued in 1911 by the ruling Qing\ndynasty, which the Communist government does not acknowledge.\n     The spokesman said the ruling \"indicates the ... Railway\nbearer bonds case is finally closed.\"\n    But a U.S. Embassy official said that two other bond cases\nwere still in litigation and it was not known if the other\ncourts involved would accept the Supreme Court ruling.\n    China has issued much of its recent overseas debt in Japan,\nand has been badly hit by the yen's sharp rise. A Western\nbanker said the U.S. Market has become more attractive to\nChina, since it is likely to issue bonds denominated in\ncurrencies other than yen, and so protect itself against future\ncurrency fluctuations.\n    But a Western diplomat warned that potential U.S. Buyers\nwould not give China the warm reception it received in Japan.\n    \"U.S. Investors are not interested in China per se, as many\nJapanese are. China has no track record in the U.S. Bond\nmarket. Investors may demand disclosure of information Chinese\ninstitutions are unwilling to give,\" he said.\n    He said potential buyers might scrutinise China's human\nrights record. Some institutions are reportedly concerned about\nrecent events in China, including a drive by the Chinese media\nagainst \"bourgeois liberalism.\"\n    An official of state-owned China International Trust and\nInvestment Corp, which has raised funds in Hong Kong, Tokyo and\nFrankfurt, declined comment on the court decision.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It\nwould impair the efficiency of some of the most efficient\nmarkets in the world,\" he said. He declined to be named.\n    In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat,\nhas called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs he\nestimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.\n    \"It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthy\nindividuals but on middle income people who occasionally invest\nand trade. So I think it's a very bad idea,\" said the official,\nwho is an administration economic policy-maker.\n    The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that the\nadministration delay next year's cut in top tax rates, called\nfor in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.\n    \"It is breaking faith with the American people ... It would\nbe a real breach of faith,\" he said.\n    The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budget\nby 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court.\n    Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass President\nReagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting this\nOctober, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108\nbillion dlr target for the budget deficit set under the\nGramm-Rudman law.\n    The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrs\nin the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts and\nrevenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal.\n    The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, also\nsaid President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budget\nsummit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue.\n    The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recently\nafter Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed a\ndeficit reduction package and an arms control accord with\nMoscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal.\n    But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as an\nattempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accused\nthem of being overly critical before they had written their own\nbudget proposal, due out on April 1.\n    \"It's easier to write a book review than it is to write a\nbook.

  "body": "U.S. banks and savings and loan\ninstitutions could face important changes as a result of\nemergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate\nBanking Committee.\n    The bill approved 12-6 yesterday would rescue the\nunderfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts and\ntemporarily halt new developments in the provision of financial\nservices.\n    The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse a\nbadly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and Loan\nInsurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors.\n    It also limits banks' ability to sell securities and\nrestricts a new breed of competitor, the so-called nonbank\nbanks.\n    Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bill's sponsor,\npromised the committee will work on a long-term plan for new\ndevelopments in the financial services industry, which is\nconfronted by growing competition from firms in other\ncommercial centers, such as London and Tokyo.\n    \"This bill we are taking up today is the first step in this\neffort,\" the Wisconsin Democrat said.\n    But Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's top Republican,\nchastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions on\nfinancial providers.\n    \"It is time to forget the special interests,\" the Utah\nsenator said.\n    Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that would\nhave eliminated virtually all of the bill's provisions except\nthe rescue for FSLIC.\n    A major controversy focused on nonbank banks, which offer\nlimited financial services of a bank and avoid most banking\nregulations.\n    Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permit\nnew nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passes\ncomprehensive bank reform, a move welcomed by the bank\nindustry.\n    But at the same time, the bill set a moratorium on a number\nof new activities that banks may undertake, including selling\ninsurance, securities and real estate for one year after the\nbill becomes law.\n    The 7.5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented a\ncompromise between a larger amount sought by the Reagan\nadministration and a smaller figure proposed by the thrift\nindustry.\n    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an industry group,\nfeared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to a\nsurge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors.\n    \"We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number,\"\nWilliam O'Connell, president of the league, said after the\ncommittee voted.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "The oil services industry is on the\nverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil\nindustry analysts said.\n    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some\nstocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the\nsecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the\nfirst half, and continue into the next decade.\n     \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go\nup to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research\nanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.\n    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>,\nHalliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker\nInternational <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>,\nwhich may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a\nDallas-based investor.\n    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing\nexploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in\noil services will begin in the U.S.\n    \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up\nfaster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.\n    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766\nlast week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co\n<HT> figures show.\n    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is\nprojected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,\nvice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"The\nfirst significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the\nsecond half of 1988,\" Kerridge said.\n    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar\npattern, Kerridge said.\n    \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman,\nvice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding\nthe company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common\nstock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,\nand has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash\nflow including debt.\n    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service\nstock.\n    \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant\ntechnical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said.\n    \"Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,\nincluding a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its\nconsiderable cash horde sets the stage for the company to\nmaximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on\nthe project upturn in exploration and development activity,\"\naccording to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at\nRobert W. Baird and Co Inc.\n    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25\ncts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts\nin 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87\nbillion dlrs.\n    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil\nservice companies and said choosing among them is difficult.\nHer favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a\npossible merger with Hughes Tool Co.\n    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but\npossibly not as much as other companies because it is not a\npure service company, Sweeney said.\n    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost\nreductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and\nleaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

  "body": "Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> is\nlikely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12\npct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido\nSchmidt-Chiari said.\n    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous\nyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share\ncapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986\nfrom 2.7 billion a year earlier.\n    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when\nthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit\nof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.\n    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.\n    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose\nto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.\n    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment\nwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last\nyear's better profits had resulted from improvements in\nservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling\nlending.\n    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate\nmargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when\ncompared with those in other countries, he said.\n    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and\nabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,\nAndrosch said, but declined to give an exact figure.\n    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had\nfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,\nremoving some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet\ntotal.\n    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,\nrepresentative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong\nKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to\nabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and\ndrawing dividends.\n    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose\neight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers\nsaid improved results had been widely expected by investors.\n    Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in\n1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of\n2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's\nlargest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and\nlarge Austrian companies.\n    But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr\n-Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar\nto the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "title": "OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING",
  "body": "OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to\nfixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an\noverall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to\ndefend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.\n    He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with\nmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria\nand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold\nthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their various\nquotas and official selling prices.\"\n    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.\n    \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading\nnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member\ncountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the\nmonth of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.\n    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at\n900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm\ndetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs\nagreed upon last December in Geneva.\n    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for\nOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed\nprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.\n    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but\nfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more\nthan the agreed level.\n    \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not\nhold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of\nOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman\nsaid.\n    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based\non the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding\nthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000\nbpd.\n    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,\nwhile the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab\nEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.\n    \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement\nsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level\nof 18 dlrs,\" the group's president said.\n    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting\nformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.\n    \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is\nat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in\nDecember are being adhered to,\" he said.\n    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow\nthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in\nrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider\nthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\"\n    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn\non stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well\nbelow this time last year and soon they would return to the\nmarket in search of crude.\n    \"We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in\nmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\"\nLukman said.\n    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he\nsaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise\nprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held\nview not to do anything to help the market.\n    \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with\ntwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is\nours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said.\n    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output\nfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the\nSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quota\nwhen it recovered from the disaster.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Fekete said the rates would come into\neffect tomorrow.\n    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had\na higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its\nmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and\n5.5 pct in 1986).\n    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to\nprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of\nthe 1970s, he added.\n    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by\nbetween three and four pct early last year.\n    But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless\nfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3\nmln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.\n    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade\nsurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a\nmore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total\nhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.\n    One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of\nitself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they\nalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve the\nquality of their export goods.\"\n    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this\nyear to invest in restructuring industry.\n    It would be his role to persuade international banks to\ncooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an\nAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai\nbond market.\n    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion\ndlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a\ncurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because\nthe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt\ndenominated in marks or yen.\n    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this\nyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of\nmodernisation.\n    \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am\nagainst credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic\nproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.\n   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt\nprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term\nloans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking\nmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he\nconsidered rates to be low.\n    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at\naround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which\ntripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after\nquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was\nworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for\nthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion\nforints.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

  "body": "The U.S. merchandise trade deficit\non a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs\nin the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce\nDepartment said.\n    The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15\nbillion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously\nreported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.\n    For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a\nrecord 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,\nthe department said.\n    During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78\nbillion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports\nrose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.\n    The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes\nsuch factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and\ninsurance.\n    The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the\nquarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion\ndlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose\n1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars\nfrom Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.\n    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct\nbecause of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department\nsaid. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18\npct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars\nand a nine pct decrease from Japan.\n    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs\nor nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct\nor 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.\n    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because\nsupplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were\nlimited by drought.\n    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America\nrose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700\nmln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200\nmln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.\n    The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,\nincluding Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell\n500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit\ndecreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.\n    In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or\nnine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3\nbillion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.\n    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6\nbillion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower\nprices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs\nfrom 26.41 dlrs.\n    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct\nto 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell\n27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and\nsoybeans nine pct.\n    The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1\nbillion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe\nincreased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The company had said it could\nnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the\nearliest.\n    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee\nIacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln\ndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of\n1,200 dealers as the major attractions.\n    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually\nto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead\ncosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur\nin the AMC buyout.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
